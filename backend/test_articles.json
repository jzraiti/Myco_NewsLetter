Patients exhibit a wide spectrum of visceral and neurological manifestations, suggesting a role for genomic modifiers. To uncover the genetic basis of NPC resilience, we analyzed the exomes of an NPC family with diverse phenotypes, from very mild to severe neurological involvement. Linkage analysis revealed loss-of-function (LOF) variants in CCDC115, SLC4A5, DEPDC5, ETFDH, SNRNP200, and DOCK1 that co-segregated with resistance to severe neurological signs. Biomarkers of severity are lacking in NPC. Based on LOF variants in the yeast orthologs of these genes, we successfully predicted NPC-like severity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of different genetic backgrounds. Complementary, to associate pathways with severity, we performed RNA-seq, uncovering positive correlations between mitochondrial transcripts with cellular fitness. Finally, we modeled NPC disease in yeast lacking the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter bor1, the SLC4A5 ortholog. Deletion of bor1 enhanced cellular fitness, prevented vacuolar fragmentation, reduced sterols buildup, and improved mitochondrial function. Our study revealed modifiers/biomarkers of NPC severity, and highlighted SLC4A5 as a promising therapeutic target for this devastating disease.", "venue": "medRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-03-06", "authors": [{"authorId": "2339702848", "name": "Macarena Las Heras"}, {"authorId": "2231389001", "name": "Benjam\u00edn Szenfeld"}, {"authorId": "2060857454", "name": "Valeria Olgu\u00edn"}, {"authorId": "67077254", "name": "J.

The study shows that BocOP copolymerized with CL to produce a random PAE copolymer. Following deprotection, the PAE copolymers containing discoverable secondary amino groups demonstrate a preferent bactericidal effect against Gram-negative bacteria. The preference arises from the capacity of PAE copolymers to permeabilize the bacterial outer membrane, subsequently slightly compromising the inner membrane and resulting in the death of Gram-negative bacteria.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the yeast strain elevates the alert level to stresses related to DNA replication, unfolded protein, starvation, and hyperosmosis, and reduces the uptake of unimportant nutrients to have a higher acetic acid tolerance during adaptive evolution in hydrolyzate. Additionally, the Snf1p-Mig1p signaling pathway was reprogrammed, enabling the strain to utilize xylose more efficiently during adaptive evolution in xylose. We also confirmed that disruption of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene TDH1 significantly shortened the time required for glucose and/or xylose cofermentation under acetic acid stress by reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation and increasing ATP production.

While heterogeneity in ribosome composition has been reported in bacteria, protozoans, fungi, zebrafish, mice and humans, its functional implications remain actively debated. Here, we review recent evidence demonstrating that expression of conserved variant ribosomal DNA (rDNA) alleles in bacteria, mice and humans renders their actively translating ribosome pool intrinsically heterogeneous at the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In this context, we discuss reports that nutrient limitation-induced stress in Escherichia coli leads to changes in variant rRNA allele expression, programmatically altering transcription and cellular phenotype. We highlight that cells expressing ribosomes from distinct operons exhibit distinct drug sensitivities, which can be recapitulated in vitro and potentially rationalized by subtle perturbations in ribosome structure or in their dynamic properties. Finally, we discuss evidence that differential expression of variant rDNA alleles results in different populations of ribosome subtypes within mammalian tissues. These findings motivate further research into the impacts of rRNA heterogeneities on ribosomal function and predict that strategies targeting distinct ribosome subtypes may hold therapeutic potential.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Ribosome diversity and its impact on protein synthesis, development and disease'.", "venue": "Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The microbiome in the needles and trunk of Pinus spp. are recognized to play key roles in resistance against PWD. However, the role of root and soil microbiomes in the resistance remains unclear. This study compares bacterial and fungal communities in the root endosphere, rhizosphere soil, and bulk soil of diseased versus healthy P. koraiensis. Results showed that PWD increased the \u03b1-diversity of fungi in rhizosphere soil but did not affect the microbial diversity in the root endosphere or bulk soil. The composition of bacterial and fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils was significantly altered by PWD. Specifically, the relative abundance of Planctomycetes decreased, and the relative abundance of Tremellomycetes increased, while Agaricomycetes decreased in both rhizosphere and bulk soils after infestation with PWD, respectively. Relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia increased, while Proteobacteria decreased in bulk soil following PWD. Relative abundances of Leotiomycetes and Eurotiomycetes increased in the rhizosphere soil and bulk soil following PWD, respectively. Furthermore, with the host plant infestation by PWD, the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreases, while that of saprotrophic fungi increases in both rhizosphere and bulk soils. Our results revealed that PWD significantly affects the soil microbiomes of P. koraiensis, with varying impacts across different plant-soil compartments. This study provides insights into how root and soil microbiomes respond to PWD, enhancing our understanding of the disease's ecological consequences.IMPORTANCEThe belowground microbiome is often sensitive to infection of forest diseases and is also recognized as a potential reservoir for selection of microbial agents against PWD. Our study demonstrates that the dynamics of belowground microbiome following natural infection of PWD are compartment and taxa specific, with varying degrees of responses in both diversity and composition of bacterial or fungal communities across the root endosphere, rhizosphere soil, and bulk soil.

Yet, how they are acquired and maintained across generations, and their respective roles throughout the life cycle, remain unknown. To this end, we used high-throughput ITS sequencing analysis to characterize the fungal composition and diversity associated with A. glabripennis across three different life stages, between sexes, and between its habitats. Overall, the fungi composition was stage specific, with adult gut communities being more diverse than those of larvae and eggs. Male fungal communities differed significantly, while frass and female communities were more similar to each other. The top 10 most abundant genera were investigated, with Fusarium consistently observed in all samples and exhibiting the highest overall abundance. Function predictions revealed the presence of potentially beneficial fungi that may support A. glabripennis invasion across all groups. Additionally, we observed complex network structures in the fungal communities associated with eggs and males, and stronger positive correlations in those of eggs and newly hatched larvae. Source tracking analysis suggested that these fungi were vertically transmitted, following a transmission pathway of \u2018female gut\u2013frass\u2013egg\u2013larval gut\u2019, occurring via frass deposited in oviposition sites.

However, the microbial mechanism underlying MP-induced SOC and nutrient dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impacts of two common MPs (polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride) on microbial hierarchical groups (bacteria, fungi, and protists) and the cascading effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient dynamics in two typical agricultural soils (Mollisol and Ultisol). Our results showed that MP inputs consistently reduced NO3--N concentration but increased the content of DOC and specific dissolved organic matter (DOM) components. Despite divergent responses of microbial hierarchical groups to MPs, MP inputs consistently strengthened the connectivity and cross-trophic associations of microbial multitrophic networks. Protistan nodes belonging to Cercozoa, Ciliophora, and Chlorophyta played essential roles in maintaining network connectivity in MP-treated soils. The enhanced network connectivity and cross-trophic associations primarily explained variations in soil DOC and nutrient turnover. These findings collectively indicate that MP inputs trigger DOC and nutrient turnover by enhancing the potential multitrophic interactions and species connectivity within soil micro-food webs.

These materials have been widely used in the structure of biosensors and sensors due to their excellent metallic conductivity, mechanical stability, optical absorbance, good redox capability, and higher heterogeneous electron transfer rate. In particular, the application of MXenes as nanozymes has highlighted their high performance to a great extent in biosensor domains. The growing interest in these nanozymes is attributed to their specific physicochemical features. The key enzymatic features of these materials include activities similar to oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In this review, initially, several common synthesis methods of MXenes are presented, emphasizing their significant role as nanozymes in constructing efficient sensors. Subsequently, several common applications of MXene nanozymes in food safety analysis are delved into, including the detection of bacteria, mycotoxins, antibiotic residues, and pesticide residues, along with their applications in different electrochemical and optical biosensors.

Fungi in biocrusts help aggregate these communities and may form symbiotic relationships with nearby plants. Climate change threatens biocrusts, particularly moss biocrusts, but its effects on the biocrust mycobiome remain unknown. Here, we performed a culture-dependent and metabarcoding survey of the moss biocrust mycobiome across an aridity gradient to determine whether local climate influences fungal community composition. As the local aridity index increased, fungal communities exhibited greater homogeneity in beta diversity. At arid and hyper-arid sites, communities shifted toward more extremotolerant taxa. We identified a significant proportion of fungal reads and cultures from biocrusts that could not be classified. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and R. paludigena were significantly enriched following surface sterilization of healthy biocrust mosses. This aligns with their known roles as plant endophytes. We also observed septate endophyte colonization in the photosynthetic tissues of mosses from arid climates. Collectively, these results suggest that the biocrust mycobiome will undergo significant shifts in diversity due to climate change, favoring extremotolerant taxa as climate conditions intensify.

However, the effect of native mixed microbial inoculants on soil microbiota and plant growth remain to be elucidated. Here, we used pot experiment for 5 months to determine the microbial inoculants treatments with growth-promoting effect on Cajanus cajan, such as M1P (Serratia marcescens) treatment and M1H treatment: the mixture of M1P and M45N (Paenibacillus polymyxa), and investigate the effect of these inoculants on the capacity of soil nutrients and rhizosphere microbiomes in promoting C. cajan growth. Further, the adaptability of these strains to environmental stress (temperature and pH) was determined by using stress-resistant growth experiment. The results showed that M1H treatment resulted in soil nutrients consumption and led to substantial alterations in the microbial community that were more effective in promoting C. cajan growth. The enhanced plant growth observed with M1H inoculation may be due to its impact on the soil micro-environment, particularly through increasing beneficial genera (e.g., Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Chryseolinea, and Bacillus) and decreasing potential genera (e.g., Zopfiella and Podospora). In addition, at the genus level (top 10), the effect of M1H inoculation on soil fungal community was higher than that of bacteria, which shows that the change of soil fungal community after M1H inoculation was more sensitive than that of bacteria. Spearman correlation analysis further revealed that the abundance of Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Chryseolinea, Zopfiella and Podospora were the key factors affecting C. cajan growth. Moreover, FUNGuild function prediction clearly indicated distinct differences in the fungal functions of CK, MIP and M1H treatment, in which a lower relative abundance of saprotroph fungi in M1H treatment compared to CK, these results may confirmed the possibility of decreasing the abundance of Zopfiella and Podospora under M1H treatment.

Nevertheless, as a low-yield soil, how fertilization strategies impact the status of albic soil physical and chemical properties, biological activity, and crop yield are poorly understood. Through a two-year positioning experiment, the albic soil fertility characteristics (physical, chemical, and biological) and changes in maize yield under different fertilization were studied. Three treatments were established: (1) conventional fertilization (chemical fertilizer) (T1), (2) optimized fertilization 1 (low amount of organic fertilizer + chemical fertilizer) (T2), and (3) optimized fertilization 2 (high amount of organic fertilizer + chemical fertilizer) (T3). The results indicated that, compared with T1, the soil bulk density of T2 and T3 treatments decreased, the average solid phase ratio of soil decreased by 8.2%, and the average liquid and gas phase ratios increased by 7.2% and 10.2%, respectively. The soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon storage (SOCS) under treatment of optimized fertilization were significantly higher than under T1, with an average increase of 10.1% for SOM and 8.8% for SOCS, respectively. T3 significantly increased the contents of alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium, while different fertilizations had little effect on soil pH. T2 and T3 significantly increased activities of soil urease, sucrase, phosphatase, and catalase, with an average increase of 33.7%, 56.9%, 32.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The numbers of soil bacteria and actinomycetes under T3 increased significantly by 30.2% and 22.0% compared to T1, while the number of fungi decreased by 6.7%. The total number of soil microorganisms increased significantly by 29.0% of T3, and the proportion of soil bacteria to the total number of microorganisms increased, while the proportion of fungi and actinomycetes decreased. The maize yield of T3 was significantly higher than under other treatments, with an increase of 2368.5 kg/ha compared to T1. Correlation analysis showed that the contents of available nutrients and organic matter, the numbers of soil bacteria and actinomycetes, and the activities of soil urease and phosphatase had the most significant impact on maize yield. The optimized fertilization, which was the organic fertilizer combined with chemical fertilizer, can improve the physical properties of albic soil, increase soil organic matter content, organic carbon storage, available nutrient content, and soil biological activity, also for maize yield. Therefore, the optimized fertilization in albic soil of Northeast China is a promising and important management option for improved soil quality and grain yield.

The objective of our research is to predict aflatoxin outbreaks in Texas-grown maize using dynamic geospatial data from remote sensing satellites, soil properties data, and meteorological data by an ensemble of models. We developed three model pipelines: two included mechanistic models that use weekly aflatoxin risk indexes (ARIs) as inputs, and one included a weather-centric model; all three models incorporated soil properties as inputs. For the mechanistic-dependent models, ARIs were weighted based on a maize phenological model that used satellite-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to predict maize planting dates for each growing season on a county basis. For aflatoxin outbreak predictions, we trained, tested and validated gradient boosting and neural network models using inputs of ARIs or weather, soil properties, and county geodynamic latitude and longitude references. Our findings indicated that between the two ARI-mechanistic models evaluated (AFLA-MAIZE or Ratkowsky), the best performing was the Ratkowsky-ARI neural network (nnet) model, with an accuracy of 73%, sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 74%. Texas has significant geographical variability in ARI and ARI-hotspot responses due to the diversity of agroecological zones (hot-dry, hot-humid, mixed-dry and mixed-humid) that result in a wide variation of maize growth and development. Our Ratkowsky-ARI nnet model identified a positive correlation between aflatoxin outbreaks and prevalence of ARI hot-spots in the hot-humid areas of Texas. In these areas, temperature, precipitation and relative humidity in March and October were positively correlated with high aflatoxin contamination events. We found a positive correlation between aflatoxin outbreaks and soil pH in hot-dry and hot-humid regions and minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity in mixed-dry regions. Conversely, there was a negative relationship between aflatoxin outbreaks and maximum soil organic matter (hot-dry region), and calcium carbonate (hot-dry, and mixed-dry). It is likely soil fungal communities are more diverse, and plants are healthier in soils with high organic matter content, thereby reducing the risk of aflatoxin outbreaks.

However, rice production continues to be severely threatened by rice blast disease caused by an ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are conserved across diverse organisms, and belongs to a class of polypeptides that are inserted into the membrane by a hydrophobic sequence located at the C- terminal region. The Guided Entry of Tail-anchored (GET) complex is responsible for the post-translational insertion of nascent TA proteins into the ER lipid bilayer. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GET pathway comprises of six known associated components Get1, Get2, Get3, Get4, Get5, Sgt2 and Ssa1 that have been identified and extensively studied. However, the role of the GET complex in rice blast fungus has not been elucidated. Here in, we identified five proteins of the GET Complex in M. oryzae namely MoGet1, MoGet2, MoGet3, MoGet4 and MoSgt2 and generated the gene knock-out mutants. Deletion of MoGET1 and MoGET2 revealed that they are required for vegetative growth, asexual reproduction and pathogenesis, while MoGet3 negatively regulates hyphal growth, asexual development and pathogenesis of M. oryzae. In contrast, loss of MoGet4 and MoSgt2 had no effect on the normal development of the rice blast fungus. We demonstrated that the MoGet2 is important in osmotic stress response while MoGet2 and MoGet3 positively and negatively regulate cell wall integrity, respectively. The MoGet1 and MoGet2 were ER-localised and indispensable for DTT-induced ER stress response. In vitro and in vivo interaction assay revealed MoGet3 has physical interaction with both MoGet1 and MoGet2 indicating the existence of possible synergistic function amongst the Get components in rice blast fungus.

BR-PCR may be a powerful tool to reveal microbial causes of infectious diseases, but the impact on diagnosis and clinical management has yet to be fully defined. Consequently, the aims here were to investigate how bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial (AFB) BR-PCR perform compared to microbiology culture methods in detecting microorganisms and to assess clinical utility, defined as the ability of the results to change antimicrobial therapy or treatment duration. Between 2018 and 2021, 348 unique specimens were sent from 327 patients seen within the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. Organisms identified by BR-PCR were compared to bacterial (n = 302), fungal (n = 137), and AFB (n = 111) cultures to determine concordance and were evaluated to determine if they led to a change in clinical management. Agreement in organism(s) reported by BR-PCR and culture was considered concordant for calculating performance data. Sensitivity of BR-PCR compared to concordant culture results was 30.9% for bacteria (25/81; 95% CI: 21.8-41.6%), 18.8% for fungi (3/16; 95% CI: 5.8-43.8%), and 33.3% for AFB (1/3; 95% CI: 5.6-79.8%) detection. The bacterial negative percent agreement of 80.1% (165/206) may reflect antibiotic pretreatment or detection of fastidious organisms. Despite longer turnaround times, BR-PCR results changed clinical care in 6% of cases. Based on these findings herein, the clinical use of BR-PCR would be best utilized when fastidious organisms are suspected, or specimens remain culture negative, but should not replace routine culture methods at this time.IMPORTANCEDetermining infectious etiology can be challenging in patients with chronic presentation and in those receiving empiric therapy. In addition to the standard of care (microbiology cultures), providers can order a broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing (BR-PCR) test to identify microorganisms directly from clinical specimens and independently from culture. While studies have been done from individual hospitals or systems, there is a lack of broadly applicable clinical evidence detailing clinical scenarios in which BR-PCR should be utilized. This study adds to the growing body of literature surrounding BR-PCR clinical usage, examining assay performance and clinical utility of BR-PCR test results. Although BR-PCR and culture had low concordance among organisms identified, it was shown to complement the standard of care for uncommonly isolated and fastidious organisms.

Greenhouse and field tests evaluated the ability of CNPMS-22 to control Fusarium verticillioides in maize plants in vivo. The CNPMS-22 genome was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4,000 platform, and genomic analysis also included manual procedures to identify genes of interest accurately.CNPMS-22 showed antifungal activity in vitro against all fungi tested, with notable reductions in mycelial growth in both DCP and ISP experiments. In the ISP, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by CNPMS-22 also altered the mycelium coloration of some fungi. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological alterations in the hyphae of F. verticillioides in contact with CNPMS-22, including twisted, wrinkled, and ruptured hyphae. Eight cluster candidates for synthesizing non-ribosomal lipopeptides and ribosomal genes for extracellular lytic enzymes, biofilm, VOCs, and other secondary metabolites with antifungal activity and plant growth promoters were identified by genomic analysis.

This study demonstrates the successful fabrication of biohybrid materials by decorating electrospun poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) fibers with electrosprayed chitooligosaccharide (COS) and Bacillus subtilis using simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying. During electrospraying, COS formed a uniform film over the PHB fibers, serving as both an adhesive and a protective coating that maintained the viability and functionality of the embedded bacteria. SEM confirmed that bacterial spores were uniformly spread across the COS-coated biopolymer fibers. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy verified the successful deposition of COS on the fibers, while mechanical assay demonstrated enhancement in mechanical characteristics after the COS film formation on the PHB fibers compared to uncoated PHB. In addition, COS improved the wetting properties of the fibrous PHB material, creating a favorable environment for bacterial growth and development. Microbiological tests showed that the embedded B. subtilis remained viable and proliferated normally after 48 h under suitable conditions at 28 \u00b0C on agar medium.

A comparative analysis of isolate W-6, together with 51 other Colletotrichum strains, reveled 13 genes unique to the Orchidearum complex to which isolate W-6 belongs, highlighting the major facilitator superfamily transporters. The detailed analyses of MFS transporters associated with secondary metabolite gene clusters in isolate W-6 led to the identification and protein structure analyses of two key virulence factor candidates in DHA1 subclass, prlG and azaK, which were reported as efflux transporters of antibiotics in other pathogenic fungi.

KTC-EGN-CBs were developed by high-speed homogenization, followed by the probe sonication. The optimized KTC-EGN-CBs depicted lower particle size (138.8 \u00b1 1.03 nm) and PdI (0.260 \u00b1 0.006) with a high entrapment efficiency of KTC (79.73 \u00b1 1.21%) and EGN (90.92 \u00b1 2.53%). Further, KTC-EGN-CBs were loaded into the hydrogel system for ease of topical application. The ex vivo diffusion study depicted the CBs helping the KTC and EGN to exhibit significantly higher permeation and retention owing to the resemblance in cubic structure with the skin. Additionally, the in vitro antifungal study of KTC-EGN-CBs resulted in a higher zone of inhibition when compared to the plain drugs against Candida albicans. Furthermore, the effectiveness of cubosomal formulation was observed in the inhibition of planktonic growth, yeast to hyphal formation, biofilm formation, and ROS production. The antifungal activity of KTC-EGN-CBs was found to be more prominent in the infected silkworm model than the plain KTC-EGN. The cell cytotoxicity study on human keratinocyte cells and the irritation study on the hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane assay revealed the non-cytotoxic and non-irritant nature of the prepared cubosomes.

Consequently, an increasing number of researchers have started to explore the ways to improve the PUE. The symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and crop roots enhances P uptake. However, the effectiveness of AMF inoculation under field conditions depends on the environment and agronomic managements. In Inner Mongolia, China, few field experiments have been conducted on AMF inoculation in potato production. This is mainly due to low estimates of AMF colonization attributed to fungicide use in seed tuber treatments and soil mechanical disturbance caused by ridging. This study aimed to test whether inoculation with AMF after ridging at the seedling stage could improve AMF colonization in potatoes, thereby enhancing P uptake and tuber yield. Field experiments were conducted in Inner Mongolia to compare the effects of AMF inoculation after ridging at seedling stage versus inoculating seed potato with AMF during sowing, and to investigate the potential of reducing the P application rate through inoculation with AMF in potato production. The AMF colonization rate, soil hyphal density, P uptake, plant growth and tuber yield of potatoes under different treatments were measured. The results showed that compared with AMF inoculation at sowing, inoculation after ridging at the seedling stage significantly increased AMF colonization by 8 percentage points. This led to a significant improvement in P uptake and potato growth, ultimately resulting in a yield increase of approximately 6%. Further findings showed that reducing P application by 25% from the conventional rate (160\u202fkg P2O5 ha\u22121) led to significant yield loss. Whereas with AMF inoculation at the seedling stage, yield levels were maintained and the partial factor productivity of P fertilizer (PFP) was increased by an average of 39%. In conclusion, this study reveals that AMF inoculation after ridging can mitigate the negative impacts of fungicides in seed tuber treatment and ridging-caused soil disturbance on AMF colonization. It highlights importance of inoculation timing for achieving higher AMF population density. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the developed AMF inoculation enables a reduction of P fertilizer application in potato production. This provides a viable approach to enhance PUE and promote sustainable potato production in areas such as Inner Mongolia. It carries significant agronomic and environmental implications.", "venue": "Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-05", "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Xiaoyu Liu"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Jing Yu"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Jie Wei"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Yonglin Qin"}, {"authorId": "2119204266", "name": "Xiao-Xia Shi"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Kun Liu"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Liguo Jia"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Mingshou Fan"}]}, {"paperId": "5c32598f200bb0419dcb217454028cc021264bb6", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2025.1543210", "CorpusId": 276825484}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c32598f200bb0419dcb217454028cc021264bb6", "title": "Global characterization of GH3 family glycoside hydrolase genes in Fusarium verticillioides and functional analysis of FvGH3-6", "abstract": "To clarify the roles of glycoside hydrolase 3 (GH3) family genes in the growth, development, and pathogenicity of Fusarium verticillioides, GH3 family genes were identified in the genome by bioinformatics software, and their expression levels in the infection process of F. verticillioides were analyzed using transcriptome data.

The results demonstrated that a total of 19 GH3 family genes were identified in the genome of F. verticillioides, which were located on 11 chromosomes, encoding amino acids ranging from 559 to 1,034, with relative molecular weights between 61.20 and 113.97\u202fkDa, and containing 1\u20136 exons.

Inhibition zones were microscopically assessed, and regrowth checks were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFungal inhibition was achieved with the lowest exposures/doses of 5\u2009s/7.5\u2009mJ/cm2 and 10\u2009s/7 mJ/cm2 at distances of 10 and 20\u2009mm, respectively. At 10\u2009mm, the fungal inhibition zone was statistically significantly enlarged by increasing exposure/dose from 5\u2009s to 15\u2009s/22.5 mJ/cm2 for all isolates. Only Aspergillus flavus showed a further significant zone enlargement after a 30\u2009s/45 mJ/cm2 exposure/dose. Fungal inhibition zone sizes did not differ significantly between isolates after 15\u2009s exposure regardless of distance, but an increased distance led to a subjective increase in fungal regrowth. While inhibition zones decreased over time, no central growth was noted despite the lack of complete fungal eradication.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor Aspergillus and Fusarium spp., an exposure/dose of 15\u2009s at a 10\u2009mm distance/22.5\u2009mJ/cm2 may optimally align antifungal efficacy with previously reported corneal safety data.

Foliar fungi can suppress plant growth directly through pathogenic interactions, or indirectly via host growth-defense tradeoffs. The exclusion of foliar fungi allows the reallocation of resources from defense to growth and reproduction. In addition, plants also invest photosynthates in rhizodeposition, or root exudates, which play a significant role in shaping the rhizosphere microbial community. However, it remains unclear what impact the exclusion of foliar fungi has on the allocation of resources to rhizodeposition and the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community. Using a 6-year foliar fungicide study in plots planted with 16 species of native prairie plants, we asked whether foliar fungi influence the rhizosphere microbial composition of a common prairie grass (Andropogon gerardii) and a common legume (Lespedeza capatita). We found that foliar fungicide increased aboveground biomass and season-long plant production, but did not alter root biomass, seed production, or rhizosphere microbial diversity. The magnitude of change in aboveground season-long plant production was significantly associated with the magnitude of change in the rhizosphere microbial community in paired foliar fungicide-treated vs. control plots. These results suggest important coupling between foliar fungal infection and plant investment in rhizodeposition to modify the local soil microbial community.", "venue": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-05", "authors": [{"authorId": "2237963185", "name": "Brett R Lane"}, {"authorId": "89601263", "name": "Molly Kuhs"}, {"authorId": "2131563243", "name": "Max M Zaret"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Zewei Song"}, {"authorId": "3135251", "name": "E.

Fungi such as Aspergillus may colonize pulmonary bullae. Although less common, colonization by Histoplasma capsulatum in a heavily endemic area is possible or even probable. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), apical bullae are characteristic. Since COPD is common and CCPH is rare, the pathogenesis of CCPH remains incompletely understood. What is presently known about the pathogenesis of CCPH has not changed appreciably since 1976. A cellblock from a patient with CCPH was analyzed with histochemical stains for T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and macrophages to better understand the pathogenesis of CCPH. The pathogenesis of cavitary disease in histoplasmosis has been assumed to resemble that of tuberculosis. However, liquefaction of a caseous focus in lung apices which resulted from blood-borne tubercle bacilli is distinctly unlike CCPH, as caseation is unusual. Rather, repeated colonization of the apical and other bullae by propagules (microconidium, macroconidium, hyphal fragment) of H. capsulatum in patients with COPD who have resided in heavily endemic areas appears to be the primary event in CCPH. Immunohistochemical enumeration of specific cell types in a patient with CCPH has not been previously carried out to our knowledge, but is only a first step in understanding the disease. In future studies, identification of the varieties of macrophages and cytokines in CCPH may reveal whether the process is pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, or both.", "venue": "Journal of Fungi", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-05", "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "John F.

Among them, Fusarium stalk rot (FSR) causes an average global yield loss of 4.5%. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, and moniliformin persist in grain and silage after harvest and pose a risk to human and animal health. This review describes the lifestyle of the fungal pathogens that cause FSR, studies how to optimize resistance evaluation, identifies quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate genes (CGs), and, finally, considers the methods for selecting FSR resistance, especially through genomic selection. To screen maize genotypes for FSR resistance, several artificial inoculation methods have been employed in most studies, including toothpick insertion, ball-bearing pellets, root infection, and the oat kernel method. However, these methods have several limitations in effectively inducing FSR disease infection. Needle injection of inoculum into the stem is recommended, especially when combined with a quantitative or percentage scale because it effectively phenotypes maize populations for FSR resistance. Nine studies with larger populations (\u2265150 progenies) investigated the genetic architecture of FSR resistance. The inheritance is clearly quantitative. Four major QTLs and several minor QTLs are reported to confer resistance to FSR pathogens, and a few CGs have been identified. Genomic selection is recommended as an effective method for developing routinely FSR-resistant maize, but only two studies have explored this area. An omics analysis (proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) of the expression of candidate genes should validate their role in FSR resistance, and their use might accelerate selection.", "venue": "Plants", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-05", "authors": [{"authorId": "2282690286", "name": "Desmond Darko Asiedu"}, {"authorId": "4631559", "name": "T.

While gut microbial communities are dynamic and sensitive to seasonal and resource variations, their specific responses in Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 langurs remain poorly characterized. This study investigates seasonal variations in the composition and diversity of gut bacterial and fungal communities in this species to enhance understanding of its ecological adaptations.Fresh fecal samples from 22 Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 langurs in Mayanghe National Nature Reserve, China, were collected across four seasons. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing to assess taxonomic composition and \u03b1-diversity. Statistical comparisons were conducted to evaluate seasonal differences at phylum and genus levels.Significant seasonal shifts occurred in both bacterial and fungal communities. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity peaked in warmer seasons, whereas fungal diversity was higher in colder months. At the genus level, Akkermansia (1.3% relative abundance in summer), a mucin-degrading bacterium linked to gut health, dominated warmer seasons. In contrast, the fungal genus Cercophora, associated with plant biomass degradation, was enriched during colder seasons. Seasonal factors strongly influenced microbial structure, with distinct community assemblages observed across all seasons.The inverse diversity patterns of bacterial and fungal communities suggest complementary roles in nutrient extraction under seasonal dietary constraints. Akkermansia\u2019s summer prevalence may reflect enhanced mucin utilization during fruit-rich periods, while Cercophora\u2019s cold-season dominance likely aids cellulose breakdown in leaf-heavy diets. These dynamics highlight the microbiota\u2019s role in optimizing energy harvest from seasonally variable diets.

Four fungal isolates resembling Alternaria were isolated from the diseased leaves. These isolates were identified as Alternaria alternata according to a combination of morphological characteristics and multigene phylogenetic analysis. To fulfill Koch\u2019s postulates, the pathogenicity of the selected isolate, YKHH, was tested on 2-year-old container seedlings of T. sinensis. Disease symptoms basically consistent with those observed in the field developed 12 days after inoculation (DAI) when either conidia or mycelia were used as the inoculum.

The obtained results indicate that yeast growth was satisfactory regardless of the inoculum size in both fermentation media. Various activities of peptidases, esterases, phosphatases, and glucosidases were observed. The yeast isolates presented metabolic activity during the process which was confirmed by the production of ethanol and acetic acid.

In our study, we found that the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in Aspergillus oryzae is more complex than that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, involving 49 enzymes and 25 reactions. In this study, we systematically analyzed the expression pattern and subcellular localization of A. oryzae ergosterol synthases and their effects on ergosterol and fatty acid metabolism. The results showed that ergosterol synthase genes were distributed across the eight chromosomes of the A. oryzae genome and were differentially expressed at different growth times. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the mevalonate biosynthesis-related enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and peroxisomes; farnesyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis-related enzymes were mainly localized in the cytoplasm, peroxisomes, and mitochondria; while several ergosterol biosynthesis-related enzymes were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Overexpression (OE) of these enzymes affected both ergosterol and fatty acid contents in A. oryzae. The ergosterol content was the highest in the AoHmgB-OE strain and the lowest in the AoHmgA-OE strain, while the fatty acid content was the highest in the AoErg26B-OE strain and the lowest in the AoErg26A-OE strain. Moreover, the ergosterol content was significantly increased in the AoHmgB/AoErg7B-, AoHmgB/AoErg9-, and AoErg1/AoErg7B-co-OE strains compared to the single gene OE strains. Our study results may offer a scientific foundation for genetic engineering research focusing on lipid metabolism in A. oryzae and related fungi, thereby facilitating the creation of fungal strains with enhanced ergosterol production.IMPORTANCEErgosterol, an important fungal cell membrane component, participates in the regulation of membrane fluidity, permeability, and material transport.

Nevertheless, the utilization of renewable plant biomass as feedstock for yeast in industrial applications remains a bottleneck, largely due to the presence of inhibitory substances such as acetic acid that are released in the biomass pretreatment processes. Exposure to acetic acid leads to different cellular stress mechanisms, several of which are directed by transcription factors. In this work, the role of the transcription factors Pdr1 and Yap1 in acetic acid tolerance was investigated using ChIP-exo and CRISPR interference/activation (CRISPRi/a). Pdr1 is the main regulator of the pleiotropic drug response, whereas Yap1 governs the oxidative stress response. CRISPRa targeting YAP1 for overexpression conferred a higher specific growth rate of S. cerevisiae, whereas CRISPRi-based downregulation of PDR1 proved to be beneficial for growth in medium containing acetic acid. ChIP-exo experiments showed increased binding of Pdr1 or Yap1 to their target promoters in the presence of acetic acid, and a large number of promoters were bound by either transcription factor. Promoters of genes involved in amino acid synthesis or encoding ABC transporters had the highest level of binding enrichment in the presence of acetic acid. The results highlight the potential for developing more acetic acid-tolerant yeast by altering the expression of transcription factor-encoding genes and demonstrate how expression can be fine-tuned by CRISPRi/a.IMPORTANCEBiotechnological conversion of plant biomass into a variety of commodity chemicals and specialty molecules is an important step towards a bioeconomy.

This study describes the diel vertical migration (DVM) of microbes within a snowpack in an alpine forest in northern Japan. Microscopy revealed the presence of snow algae, microinvertebrates, and fungi in the snowpack. 10 Periodic sampling across snow depths revealed that the vertical distribution of microbes changed over time. Motile cells of snow algae and microinvertebrates were distributed near the surface at night but migrated to a depth of 10\u201320 cm during the day. Other microbes, including algal spores and fungi, remained on the surface layer throughout the day. The vertical migration of microbes was synchronized with the intensity of solar radiation, suggesting that the microbes moved downward to avoid intense solar radiation on the snow surface. Soluble nutrients (PO 43, NH 4+ , and K + ) were always the highest at the snow surface, 15 suggesting that surface snow provides a favorable environment for microbial growth. These results indicate that motile microbes migrate diurnally within the snowpack to remain under the best conditions for their growth in terms of the intensity of solar radiation and nutrients. Snow core sampling from the surface to bottom revealed that microbes were mostly present above a depth of 30 cm in the snowpack. Therefore, the upper snow layer above this depth, referred to as the Microbial Active Snow Surface (MASS) layer, is important for the life cycles of microbes and biogeochemical cycles within snowpacks.", "venue": "Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-04", "authors": [{"authorId": "2054340526", "name": "M.

This phenomenon was suggested to be epigenetically regulated, but the previous findings did not explain which epigenetic mechanisms occur and how they promote strain degeneration. Until now, the epigenetic landscape of T. reesei has been poorly understood. This study investigated whether DNA methylation and cellulase production are connected, and, if so, what that connection is and how it relates to strain degeneration. In order to determine what the impact of DNA methylation is on strain degeneration, we induced hypomethylation with hydralazine HCL, which showed a reduced non-productive phenotype and partially restored cellulase productivity. As a second test, we conducted a global DNA cytosine methylation assay, which showed T. reesei DNA methylation levels of between 0.2 and 1.3% 5-mC. Importantly, non-productive strains exhibited stronger methylation than productive counterparts, and global methylation patterns varied depending on the carbon source. As a final test, we carried out deletion experiments targeting the putative DNA methyltransferases Dim2 and Rid1, which initially reduced the occurrence of a non-producing subpopulation, but subsequent sub-cultivation eliminated cellulase productivity. This study shows that DNA methylation impacts T. reesei cellulase productivity, an understanding that can help us develop targeted strategies to reduce strain degeneration and improve cellulase production in industrial applications.", "venue": "Microorganisms", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-04", "authors": [{"authorId": "2128643464", "name": "Caroline Danner"}, {"authorId": "2348620299", "name": "Thiago M.

Bioremediation of soil and water contamination involves a complex interplay between mass transport and biological processes. Soil adsorption, solubility, and interfacial transport limit the availability of contaminants to microorganisms. This review summarizes the recent studies about metabolic pathways and enzymes to degrade atrazine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, water and biomass carried out by some bacteria and fungi species. The biodegradation of atrazine was analyzed, considering the different metabolic pathways of bacteria and fungi. Biodegradation of atrazine by bacteria is well studied, but the fungal metabolism of this compound remains less clear. Some species of white-rot fungi can naturally biodegrade complex compounds, such as lignin, an aromatic polymer that is a major component of plant cell walls. The lignin has a polyphenolic structure that presents similarities with many aromatic pollutants and herbicides like atrazine.

This experiment investigated the effects of consecutive cropping on T. farfara over periods of 1, 2, and 3 years. It assessed the yield and quality of T. farfara flower buds, in addition to the physicochemical properties of the rhizosphere soil. The microbial community in the rhizosphere was analyzed through 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing using Illumina Novaseq high-throughput sequencing technology, while also examining the correlations among these factors. The results reveal that as the duration of continuous cropping increases, the yield of T. farfara flower buds, along with the contents of extract, tussilagone, and total flavonoids, steadily decreased; soil pH, organic matter, available phosphorus, available potassium, alkaline nitrogen, and the activities of sucrose, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase markedly decreased. As the duration of consecutive cropping increases, the quantity and diversity of bacteria in the rhizosphere soil initially increase and then decrease, while the number of fungal species increases by 22.5%. Meanwhile, continuous cropping of T. farfara contributes to a gradual reduction in the relative abundance of beneficial genera such as Ralstonia, Nitrospira, and Trichoderma in the rhizosphere soil, while harmful genera such as Mortierella, Fusarium, and Tricharina accumulate significantly. Correlation analysis shows that changes in microbial communities notably influence the growth of T. farfara and soil quality.

Additionally, Diaporthe halo blight, caused by the same fungal pathogen, was reported in Prince Edward Island (PE), Canada (Foster et al., 2024). In August of 2021, severe stem blight symptoms with visible fungal fruiting bodies were observed on >50% of plants at a hopyard in Franklin County, MA. Brown spots were observed on stems. Severe infection presented as widespread dark browning on stems, leaves, and cones. Samples were collected from the hop cultivars Mt Rainier (N=5), Magnum (N=1), and Teamaker (N=6). Under brightfield microscopy (400x) conidia congruent with Diaporthe spp. were observed on stem samples. Diseased stems from all cultivars were peeled and cut into 2 to 4 mm2 pieces, then surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 60s, and 1% NaOCl for 60s. Samples were rinsed in sterile water, dried for 3 min and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated at 25\u2103 for 5 days. 11 isolates were obtained from stem tissues of 11 plants.

Currently, there are few clinical biomarkers that reflect intestinal function or a patient's potential to wean off parenteral nutrition (PN), making it difficult to predict the clinical trajectory. By associating gut microbiome taxonomic and functional features and blood analytes with the proportion of daily energy delivered via PN-a proxy for intestinal function-our study aimed to discover potential predictors of intestinal function and PN weaning potential.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this longitudinal multiomics cohort study, we followed 18 pediatric patients with IF and PN support for \u22641.5 years. Fecal and stoma samples were analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing to assess bacterial taxonomy and function and internal transcribed spacer 2 ribosomal RNA sequencing to characterize the fungal community. Targeted metabolomics was used to quantify 257 blood analytes. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the associations of PN dependence with microbiome features and blood analytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe bacterial and fungal taxonomic composition exhibited substantial interpatient and intrapatient variability, with no link to PN dependence. In contrast, bacterial functional analysis revealed 63 MetaCyc pathways significantly associated with PN dependence. Additionally, 32 blood analytes were associated with PN dependence.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this exploratory study, we found that functional microbiome features and blood metabolomic profiles-particularly urea cycle metabolites, creatinine, asparagine, and tryptophan-derived metabolites-show promise for predicting intestinal function. Furthermore, they may have therapeutic implications for promoting intestinal adaptation.

In the lovastatin biosynthetic pathway, the polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by lovB must work together with the enoyl reductase encoded by lovC to ensure lovastatin production. However, it is unclear whether mokA and mokE in the MK gene cluster of Monascus spp., both of which are highly homologous to lovB and lovC, respectively, also have the same functions for MK biosynthesis. In the current study, the high-yielding MK M. pilosus MS-1 was used as the research object, and it was found that the enoyl reductase domain of MokA may be non-functional due to the lack of amino acids at active sites, a function that may be compensated for by MokE in the MK synthesis pathway. Then, the mokE-deleted (\u0394mokE), -complemented (\u0394mokE::mokE), and -overexpressed (PgpdA-mokE) strains were constructed, and the results showed that \u0394mokE did not produce MK, and \u0394mokE::mokE restored MK synthesis, while the ability of PgpdA-mokE to produce MK was increased by 32.1% compared with the original strain MS-1.

Rapid and effective adaptation to dynamic and contrasting host niches is associated with its pathogenicity. Recent studies have focused on genome evolution implicated in adaptive processes. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of TOR signaling is a mechanism underlying adaptive evolution in C. albicans. Clinical isolates of C. albicans exhibited enhanced commensal fitness in competition with the lab reference strain SC5314, which could be attributed to the diminished GlcNAc-responsive hypha-associated transcription in the gut. In vitro passaging of clinical isolates confers a reduction in TOR signaling, which is detrimental to fitness attributes in evolved strains, including stress response, antifungal drug tolerance, as well as in vivo commensal fitness and invasive infection. This phenomenon is observed independent of strain background and passaging environment. Importantly, inhibition of TOR signaling by rapamycin suppresses the fitness advantage observed in clinical isolates relative to their in vitro passaged derivatives. Thus, C. albicans undergoes rapid evolution via modulating TOR signaling that enables this fungus to adapt to diverse host niches.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nPathogens must be proficient at adapting to their surroundings to survive in the face of a changing microenvironment in the host and cause disease. This is particularly important for commensal-pathogenic organisms such as C. albicans as this fungus colonizes and infects mammalian hosts. Previous studies have focused on genome evolution such as aneuploidies, accumulation of point mutations, or loss of heterozygosity. Here, we demonstrate that C. albicans undergoes rapid adaptive evolution via modulating the TOR pathway. Alterations in TOR activity underlie some evolved traits with important consequences for both host adaptation and pathogenicity in C. albicans.

However, few studies have explored the changes in microbial community structure and their underlying mechanisms for improving soil P availability with the application of biochar and lime. Three kinds of biochar, made from rice straw (SB), Chinese fir wood sawdust (WB), and pig manure (MB), alone and with lime (SBL, WBL, and MBL), were applied to paddy soil to reveal the biochemical mechanisms for enhancing soil P availability. High-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR were used to investigate soil microbial communities and P functional genes. The three biochars increased the soil\u2019s available P in the order of MB > SB > WB. Biochar co-applied with lime increased the available P (Olsen-P by 169\u2013209%) and inorganic P (Al-P by 53.4\u2013161%, Fe-P by 96.3\u2013198%, and Ca-P by 59.0\u2013154%) more than biochar alone, compared to the control (CK). Both biochar alone and co-applied with lime increased the activities of alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP), phosphodiesterase (PD), and inorganic pyrophosphatase (IPP) by 369\u2013806%, 28.4\u201367.3%, and 37.9\u2013181%, respectively, while it decreased the activity of acidic phosphomonoesterase (ACP) by 15.1\u201344.0%, compared to CK.

A correlation analysis and partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) indicated that Olsen-P, Bray-1 P, and inorganic P were significantly positively correlated with the activities of ALP, PD, IPP, and the phoD gene. Biochar co-applied with lime increased the relative abundances of the phoD-harboring bacteria Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria, which promoted the transformation of P to the effective state. Meanwhile, the dominant species Anaerolinea, Ascomycota, Mucoromycota, and Chaetomium provided rich effective nutrients for the soil microorganisms by accelerating the decomposition of soil organic matter, thus promoting phosphatase activity. It could be inferred that the optimized microbial community structure improved phosphatase activity by increasing the phoD gene and available nutrients, thus promoting the soil P availability.

At 28 days after planting, scallion plants treated with B. subtilis strain CaSUT008-2 and SUNB1 gained stem length at 15.35-15.79 cm. These four biotic treatments had low disease severity in net-house conditions at 25.00-50.00 %.

Based on the transcriptome data, differentially expressed miRNA-like RNAs (DEmilRNAs) in A. apis infecting the Apis cerana cerana worker 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old larvae (Aa-4, Aa-5, and Aa-6) were screened and subjected to trend analysis, followed by target prediction and annotation as well as investigation of regulatory networks, with a focus on sub-networks relative to MAPK signaling pathway, glycerolipid metabolism, superoxide dismutase, and enzymes related to chitin synthesis and degradation. A total of 606 milRNAs, with a length distribution ranging from 18\u202fnt to 25\u202fnt, were identified. The first nucleotide of these milRNAs presented a bias toward U, and the bias patterns across bases of milRNAs were similar in the aforementioned three groups. There were 253 milRNAs, of which 68 up-and 54 down-regulated milRNAs shared by these groups. Additionally, the expression and sequences of three milRNAs were validated by stem-loop RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Trend analysis indicated that 79 DEmilRNAs were classified into three significant profiles (Profile4, Profile6, and Profile7). Target mRNAs of DEmilRNAs in these three significant profiles were engaged in 42 GO terms such as localization, antioxidant activity, and nucleoid. These targets were also involved in 120 KEGG pathways including lysine biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, and biosynthesis of antibiotics.

However, the specific changes and underlying mechanisms by natural restoration that influence the multifunctionality of karst ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, soil, litter, and fine root samples were collected from four chronosequence stages of vegetation restoration\u2014grassland (G), shrubland (SH), shrub-tree land (ST), and forest (F)\u2014within a karst ecosystem in Southwestern China. The aim was to evaluate the impacts of vegetation restoration on ecosystem multifunctionality using an averaging approach. The results demonstrated that the indices of C-cycling functionality, N-cycling functionality, P-cycling functionality, and total ecosystem multifunctionality increased as vegetation restoration progressed, along with plant diversity. The structure of plant, bacterial, and fungal communities varied across different stages of vegetation restoration, exhibiting the highest microbial diversity indices in the SH stage. Additionally, the tightness and complexity of co-occurrence networks of bacteria and fungi increased with advancing vegetation restoration, and higher positive links were observed in fungi than bacteria. The four functional indices were significantly and positively correlated with increasing plant diversity, fine root and litter nutrient contents, fine root biomass, microbial biomass, fungal community, enzyme activities, and soil nutrient contents but not with bacterial and fungal diversities. Furthermore, Random Forest model results revealed that plants exerted a significantly greater influence on ecosystem multifunctionality compared to other factors. It is plausible that plants influence soil microbial biomass, fungal community and co-occurrence networks, enzyme activities, and nutrient levels through the input of root and litter nutrients rather than by altering microbial diversity to enhance karst ecosystem multifunctionality.

These hypersaline habitats are commonly covered by halophytic vegetation. Moreover, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are an essential component of these habitats and exhibit a unique adaptation and contribute significantly to ecosystem variability, diversity, and function. Additionally, AMF from saline habitats are an essential component for the successful rehabilitation of salinity-affected areas. Despite their importance, little is known about the distribution and abundance of AMF along inland and coastal sabkhat of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the abundance and diversity of AMF in the coastal and inland sabkhat of Saudi Arabia. Five soil samples, each from five randomly selected spots (considering the presence of dominant and co-dominant halophytic species), were collected from every location and were used to assess the AMF abundance and diversity. The study indicated that the highest number of AMF spores was recorded from Jouf, averaging \u2248 346 spores 100 g\u22121 dry soil, and the lowest from Uqair, averaging \u2248 96 spores 100 g\u22121 dry soil. A total of 25 AMF species were identified, belonging to eight identified genera viz., Acaulospora, Diversispora, Gigaspora, Scutellospora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus, and Rhizophagus and five families. Of the total identified species, 52% belonged to the family Glomeraceae. Moreover, the highest number of species was isolated from the sabkha in Qasab. Additionally, Glomeraceae was abundant in all the studied locations with the highest relative abundance in Uqair (48.34%). AMF species Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Funneliformis mosseae, Glomus ambisporum, and Rhizophagus intraradices were the most frequently isolated species from all the Sabkha locations with isolation frequency (IF) \u2265 60%, and Claroideoglomus etunicatum (Ivi \u2265 50%) was the dominant species in all the studied locations. Furthermore, data on the Shannon\u2013Wiener diversity index showed that the highest AMF species diversity was in Qaseem and Qasab habitats. The highest Pielou\u2019s evenness index was recorded in Jouf. Moreover, the soil parameters that positively affected the diversity of identified species included Clay%, Silt%, HCO31\u2212, OM, MC, N, and P, while some soil parameters such as EC, Na+, SO42\u2212, and Sand% had a significant negative correlation with the isolated AMF species.

Meeting the growing demands for food protein, improved nutritional quality, and environmental sustainability requires transitioning from animal-sourced products. Plant-based products have emerged as the most prominent and major alternative solution toward improving the current food production system; however, plant-based products come with their flaws. Generating flavorful, nutritious, and high-protein products derived entirely from plant sources typically lacks consumer acceptance. However, the growing field of precision fermentation within food systems offers a substantial field toward enhancing and revolutionizing current plant-based products to derive more nutritious, flavorful, and textural analogs. Precision fermentation entails genetically modifying microorganisms such as yeast, bacteria, microalgae, fungi, and more to generate specific products such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and flavonoids. Precision fermentation is critical for closing the nutritional and flavor gap between plant and traditional animal-based products. This process provides controlled production of key ingredients that may improve the final product's safety, quality, sustainability, and sensory value. Currently, the most well-known example of precision fermented products integrated into plant-based foods is the heme protein integrated into plant-based burgers, but there is even greater potential.

We found levels of leaf storage lipids (triacylglycerols, TAGs) are 3.5-fold higher in whole Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves with a 15-fold increase in storage lipids at the infection site during fungal asexual reproduction. Lipid bodies, not observable in uninfected mature leaves, were found in and external to chloroplasts in mesophyll cells underlying the fungal feeding structure. Concomitantly, thylakoid disassembly occurred and thylakoid membrane lipid levels decreased. Genetic analyses showed that canonical endoplasmic reticulum TAG biosynthesis does not support powdery mildew spore production. Instead, Arabidopsis chloroplast-localized DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 3 (DGAT3) promoted fungal asexual reproduction. Consistent with the reported AtDGAT3 preference for 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates, which are dominant in thylakoid membrane lipids, dgat3 mutants exhibited a dramatic reduction in powdery mildew-induced chloroplast TAGs, attributable to decreases in TAG species largely comprised of 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates.

(HP) extract using nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as delivery platforms. Methods: Two established NLC specimens, comprising glyceryl behenate and almond oil or borage oil, and their extract-loaded counterparts (HP-NLCs) were utilized. Their minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC; MFC) were investigated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The anti-herpesvirus (HSV-1) potential was evaluated concerning antiviral and virucidal activity and impact on viral adsorption. Results: The borage oil-based extract-loaded nanodispersion (HP-NLC2) exhibited pronounced microbicidal activity against S. aureus (MBC 6.3 mg/mL), K. pneumoniae (MBC 97.7 \u00b5g/mL), and C. albicans (MFC < 48.8 \u00b5g/mL), unlike the almond oil-containing sample (HP-NLC1), which showed only weak inhibition of the fungal growth. HP-NLC2 was found to be less cytotoxic and to suppress HSV-1 replication slightly more than HP-NLC1, but generally, the effects were weak. Neither the empty lipid nanoparticles nor the HP extract-loaded carriers expressed activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, the HSV-1 extracellular virions, or viral adhesion. Conclusions: It could be concluded that both HP-NLC samples revealed only minor antiherpetic potential of the hyperforin-rich extract, but HP-NLC2 demonstrated significant antibacterial and antimycotic activity. Therefore, the latter was featured as a more convenient HP-carrier system for nano-designed dermal pharmaceutical formulations.

Acclimatization is a critical step in this approach. The purpose of this study was to improve the survival and development rate of kopyor coconut seedlings grown in vitro during the acclimatization phase by using biological, organic, and mixed organic-biological biostimulants. This study employed a completely randomized block design that comprised the inclusion of biological, organic, and mixed biological-organic biostimulants, with no biostimulant as a control. The biological stimulant employed in this study was arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), while the organic biostimulant was seaweed extract. Each treatment had 50 plantlets in triplicate. The results demonstrated that the treatment of biological and organic biostimulants increased plantlet survival rates during acclimatization, beginning 2 months after application and remaining consistent for 4 months. The biological stimulant application produced the highest plantlet survival rate (>94%). Based on how quickly the plantlets transitioned to the next stage, it was discovered that after 2-months incubation, most of the plantlets had already transferred to the second phase of acclimatization (opened tunnel). After 4-months incubation, the biological stimulant treatment produced the most plantlets at the later stage. However, throughout the 4-month acclimation period, more plantlets were transported from the pre-nursery to the main nursery, particularly with the use of organic biostimulants (56-64%). \nKeywords: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, plantlet, survival rate, seaweed", "venue": "Jurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-04", "authors": [{"authorId": "2274697958", "name": "M.

The bitterness, astringency, sweetness after taste, sourness and fermentation taste tended to increase with fermentation. The highest lactic acid bacteria, aerobic bacteria, total titratable acidity, total soluble sugar, total polyphenols, and total flavonoids were recorded at the second month of fermentation, while fungi, total free amino acids, total antioxidant capacity and hydroxyl free radical scavenging capacity increased with fermentation. Mantel test demonstrated significant associations between lactic acid bacteria /fungal communities and taste characteristics. UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis led to the identification of 35 differential non-volatile metabolites, predominantly comprising heterocyclic compounds, organic acids with their derivatives, and flavonoids.

Aflatoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain mold species, primarily Aspergillus flavus. The extent of Aspergillus fungal invasion in maize grains and the resulting increase in aflatoxin levels is heavily influenced by pre-and post-harvest practices. Before harvest, factors such as insect damage and exposure to warm, humid conditions increase the crop's susceptibility to Aspergillus infection and subsequent aflatoxin formation. Post-harvest, additional risks arise when kernels are damaged by pests like rats or when they are stored in unfavorable conditions for extended periods, leading to significant aflatoxin accumulation. This study examined the prevalence of aflatoxin contamination in maize and its association with the physical and nutritional characteristics of grains collected from 49 informal markets across eight sub-Counties in Meru County, Kenya. A total of 353 maize samples were collected from traders. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine aflatoxin levels, while proximate analyses of ground maize grain samples were conducted in duplicate, following the guidelines of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). The physical characteristics of maize grains including the proportions of undamaged, broken, and insect-damaged grains along with moisture content, were also assessed. The average aflatoxin level in maize samples was 8.66 ppb, with 35.2% containing less than one ppb (low or none), 47.8% falling between 1\u201310 ppb (moderate), and 17.0% exceeding 10 ppb (high). Physical factors found to be positively correlated with aflatoxin contamination included high proportion of broken grains, insect damage, and elevated moisture content. However, nutritional parameters, including fat, starch, and protein content, were consistent across sub-Counties and did not significantly associate with aflatoxin levels. To mitigate aflatoxin contamination, the study recommends implementing management practices such as ensuring adequate drying of maize to a moisture content below 13%, proper storage and transportation, and optimizing threshing and harvesting times to improve kernel quality.

Nonetheless, it remains unknown how global warming affects cellulose-decomposing microorganisms. Here, we carried out a three-year litterbag experiment to examine cellulose decomposition undergoing +3\u00b0C warming in a tallgrass prairie. Most cellulose-associated bacteria and fungi in litterbags were also detected in bulk soil, and bacteria in litterbags had higher community-level rrn copy numbers, larger genome sizes, and higher genome GC contents than those in bulk soil, implying higher growth rates. Warming stimulated soil respiration by 32.3% and accelerated mass loss of cellulose, concurring with the increase in relative abundances of most functional genes associated with carbon decomposition in litterbags. Incorporating cellulose-decomposing genes into an ecosystem model reduced model parameter uncertainty and showed that warming stimulated microbial biomass, activity, and soil carbon decomposition. Collectively, our study supports a trait-centric view since cellulose-decomposing genes or genomic traits are amenable for ecosystem modeling.

Furthermore, we critically evaluated two methodological frameworks for assessing mycotoxin exposure risks: (1) dietary exposure models integrating contamination levels and consumption data and (2) human biomonitoring approaches quantifying mycotoxin biomarkers in biological samples. A key contribution lies in the stratified analysis of exposure disparities among population subgroups (adults, teenagers, children, and infants).

Eighteen rumen-fistulated beef calves were fed a concentrate plus pelleted barley straw separately (CS; n = 9) or as TMR (n = 9). Average daily gain and intake of TMR and of straw and concentrate with the CS treatment were recorded. Digestibility was estimated using ashes insoluble in hydrochloric acid as a marker. Rumen liquid and gas samples were obtained, and the abundance of total bacteria, methanogens, protozoa, and anaerobic fungi was analysed. Animals were slaughtered at 500 kg live weight (LW), and dressing percentage and carcass classification were obtained. Another 49 animals for each treatment were used on a commercial farm to exclusively assess animal performance. The treatment (CS or TMR) did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) final LW, average daily gain, carcass dressing percentage, dry matter or digestible organic matter intake, digestibility values, production of methane and carbon dioxide, and abundance of microorganisms in the rumen. However, animals fed TMR had lower rumen pH (5.87 vs. 5.58, p = 0.041 for CS and TMR), suggesting a higher risk of experiencing rumen acidosis than those fed straw and concentrate separately.

Chronic sinus infections unresponsive to antibiotics should raise suspicion for fungal rhinosinusitis. Various types of fungi cause inflammation of the sinus mucosa. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses that can be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, or fungi. Fungal sinusitis is the rarest form of sinusitis. Fungal sinusitis can be classified based on the severity into invasive and non-invasive types. The severity of fungal sinusitis depends on the patient's immune status. Consequently, invasive fungal sinusitis often occurs in patients with chronic diseases that impair the immune system, such as diabetes mellitus (DM). This condition can lead to dangerous complications, including the rapid spread of the fungus to the eyes, brain, and surrounding tissues. Therefore, the diagnosis and management of invasive fungal sinusitis should be conducted promptly and accurately. The incidence of fungal sinusitis is rarely encountered; however, in recent decades, the incidence has been reported to be increasing. In Asia, the incidence of fungal sinusitis accounts for 42% of all rhinosinusitis cases. Symptoms vary depending on the patient's immune status. CT scan is one of the imaging methods that can be used to assist in the diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis and provide important information for appropriate management, leading to more accurate and rapid treatment. Fungal sinusitis occurs when airborne fungi adhere to the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity and sinuses through respiratory inhalation. Fungal sinusitis manifests in various forms, ranging from simple irritation of the sinus mucosa to life-threatening disease. Fungal sinusitis may be asymptomatic, but common symptoms include purulent rhinorrhea, facial pain, and postnasal drip. Diagnosing fungal sinusitis through nasal endoscopy is challenging. In computed tomography (CT), fungal sinusitis is characterized by observations such as calcifications, heterogeneous soft tissue density lesions, and periosteal thickening.

We examined the effects of BS2-6 infestation on the ultrastructure of sugarcane leaves. Moreover, we sequenced the whole genome of BS2-6 and examined the effects of various nitrogen sources and chemical reagents on its growth and pathogenicity. Our results indicate that sugarcane leaves inoculated with BS2-6 quickly succumb to heart leaf and growing rot. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the surface tissues of the diseased leaves were destroyed with mycelium, and conidia blocked leaf stomata, which ultimately led to the degradation of leaf tissues. Ammoniacal nitrogen significantly promoted mycelial growth, pigment secretion, and the expression of genes related to secondary metabolite synthesis, thereby accelerating the development of PBD. In addition, we found that carbendazim effectively inhibited the growth of BS2-6 at various concentrations.

Reproduction tests were conducted in natural agricultural soil, and the springtails were exposed to 3 concentrations of the selected pesticides: the median environmental concentration (MEC), the predicted environmental concentration (PEC), and 5 times PEC (5PEC). No significant effect was observed at MEC exposure in any case study sites, however, effects on reproduction, adult survival, and adult size were observed at PEC and 5PEC exposures on 5 case study sites. Risk quotients (RQ) of individual pesticides were calculated by dividing the exposure concentrations (MEC, PEC, and 5PEC) by the NOEC values from the literature, and the sum of the 5 pesticides was calculated as \u2211RQ in each case study site. The toxicity at PEC exposure was higher than expected based on the \u2211RQ in two case study sites, indicating a possible synergistic mixture effect.

Ubiquitous in fungi and insects, chitin is absent inmammals and plants and, thus, represents a microbeassociatedmolecular pattern (MAMP). However, highly polymeric chitin is insoluble, which potentially hampers recognition by host immune sensors. In plants, secreted chitinases degrade polymeric chitin into diffusible oligomers, which are \u201cfed to\u201d innate immune receptors and co-receptors. In human and murine immune cells, a similar enzymatic activity was shown for human chitotriosidase (CHIT1), and oligomeric chitin is sensed via an innate immune receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. However, a complete system of generating MAMPs from chitin and feeding them into a specific receptor/co-receptor-aided sensing mechanism has remained unknown in mammals.The effect of the secreted chitinolytic host enzyme, CHIT1, on the TLR2 activity of polymeric chitin preparations from shrimps, house dust mites and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans was assessed in vitro using cell lines and primary immune cells. Moreover, the regulation of CHIT1 was analyzed.Here, we show that CHIT1 converts inert polymeric chitin into diffusible oligomers that can be sensed by TLR1/TLR2 co-receptor/receptor heterodimers, a process promoted by the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and CD14. Furthermore, we observed that Chit1 is induced via the b-glucan receptor Dectin-1 upon direct contact of immortalized human macrophages to the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, whereas the defined fungal secreted aspartyl proteases, Sap2 and Sap6, from C. albicans were able to degrade CHIT1 in vitro.Our study shows the existence of an inducible system of MAMP generation in the human host that enables contact-independent immune activation by diffusible MAMP ligands with a striking similarity to the plant kingdom.

Mycotoxin and mycotoxin by oxidized oil interaction also increased beta diversity based on the variability in microbial community in the ileal content while increasing the abundance of bacterial taxa, including Streptomyces and Escherichia-Shigella, and predicted pathways related to RNA and DNA synthesis (Mycothiol and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides synthesis) and redox regulation (ergothioneine biosynthesis) in ileal content and pathways related to glycol metabolism and degradation and amino acids degradation were increased in the cecal content.

Because of these benefits, there has been a recent uptick in the number of uses for DESM, such as using it as a solvent in a variety of different separation procedures. Itraconazole (ICZ) was classified as a BCS-II medication. DESM technique was used to enhance the solubility of the drug by reducing the crystallinity region of the drug molecule. In different molar ratios Drugs, carboxylic acid, and choline chloride were used. From the carboxylic acid urea showed the best solubility profile. So it was chosen for fabricating the topical gel formulations. The prepared gel exhibits a pH nearly equal to the skin pH. Increasing the carbopol amount increases the viscosity and decreases the spreadability. From the FTIR analysis, it was found that ICZ peaks were preserved in the formulations, and no extra peak suggested the absence of interaction between the drug and excipients. In the release study, it was found that the release of the drug was sustained by increases in the carbopol. Release kinetics showed the drug was released from the gel by both fickian and non-fickian mechanisms. From the docking study, it has been established that ICZ has a strong binding affinity towards candida pepsin-2 (-9.3Kcal/mol). From the above finding, it was established that the Development and optimization of itraconazole-loaded topical gel using DESM Technique was successfully prepared.

An experiment was conducted at the Simcoe Research Station in Norfolk County, Ontario to assess the effectiveness of commercially available plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbial biocontrols to treat ARD. Five treatments were replicated in-field five times as a randomized block design.

Trees growth and health and rhizosphere microbial diversity was assessed at three points over two years. PGP-R produced the greatest mean root mass followed by the chemical fumigation, which was 32% and 10% more root mass than the untreated control, respectively. Chemical fumigation resulted in the greatest above-ground biomass tree growth followed by the PGP-R, accumulating 30% and 6% more biomass than the untreated control. However, PGP-F accumulated less biomass than the untreated control. FC and PGP-R both resulted in strong growth but impacted the microbial community differently. PGP-R increased rhizosphere bacterial diversity and decreased fungal diversity while FC did the opposite. PGP-R changes to bacterial communities persisted while FC soils resembled the untreated control most closely after two years.

However, it is unclear how the immunologic and genetic background of inbred mouse strains affects disease outcome during C. neoformans infection. In this study, we show that a hypervirulent phenotype is dependent on the host immune response and mouse genetic background. A/J mice intranasally infected with the hypervirulent isolates, UgCl247, UgCl422, and UgCl236, have increased neutrophil and T-cell recruitment when compared with infection with the reference strain KN99\u03b1. In addition, the cytokine profile of the hypervirulent isolates in A/J mice had a profound IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 response, and lung resident CD4 T-cells isolated from A/J mice expressed significantly increased Th1 (CXCR3, Tbet) and Th17 (ROR\u03b3T) markers compared with KN99\u03b1 infection. Intriguingly, when C57BL/6J mice were infected with these isolates, the hypervirulent phenotype was not evident, and all isolates had virulence comparable to the KN99\u03b1 control.

Biofilm formation is a potent virulence factor for Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis, that confers significant resistance to antifungal agents and to the innate immune response. Echinocandins such as anidulafungin are new drugs that broaden the available therapeutic arsenal for invasive fungal infection treatment. Here we evaluated the effect of anidulafungin, human-Monocytes and combined treatment on mature biofilms of clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis with different intrinsic capacity to form biofilm, and on biofilm with low (LB) and high biomass (HB). Methods Yeasts from blood isolates were molecularly identified. Lipase and acid aspartic protease production, adhesion capacity, and ability to form biofilm were evaluated; strains were classified as Weak, Moderate or Strong biofilm forming capacity. Mature biofilm with LB and HB were incubated with anidulafungin, THP-1 cell alone or exposed to both, for 22 h. Fungal damage induced by antifungal agents and/or monocytes was determined by XTT[2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl) 2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] metabolic assay. Results Our results showed that anidulafungin alone could be effective to reduce mature biofilms with LB of most of the C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates, independent of intrinsic BF capacity of the strain. Anidulafungin in combination with human-Monocytes was effective in biofilm with LB of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis sensu stricto clinical isolates.

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of P. terrae B6a as a biocontrol agent against Fusarium proliferatum PPRI 31301, focusing on its in vitro antagonistic activity, its impact on fungal morphology and enzymatic content, and its ability to mitigate pathogen-induced stress in maize plants. In vitro antagonistic activity of B6a against F. proliferatum was carried out using standard protocol. In planta assay was carried out by bio-priming of maize seeds with 1 \u00d7 106\u202fCFU/mL of B6a and infected with F. proliferatum for 7\u202fdays. Biochemical, enzymatic and antioxidants activities of bio-primed maize roots under F. proliferatum infection was carried out using spectrophotometric methods. In vitro antagonistic assays using dual culture and intracellular crude metabolites inhibited 70.15 and 71.64%, respectively, of F. proliferatum. Furthermore, B6a altered the morphology and mycelia structure of F. proliferatum under High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). This was supported by an increase (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the chitin contents (48.03%) and a decrease (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the extracellular polysaccharide content (48.99%) and endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase activity (42.32%).

However, gene expression cannot yet be systematically predicted from genome sequences, in part because non-functional matches to the sequence patterns (motifs) recognized by transcription factors (TFs) occur frequently throughout the genome. Large-scale functional genomics data for many TFs has enabled characterization of regulatory networks in experimentally accessible cells such as budding yeast. Beyond yeast, fungi are important industrial organisms and pathogens, but large-scale functional data is only sporadically available. Uncharacterized regulatory networks control key pathways and gene expression programs associated with fungal phenotypes. Here we explore a sequence-only approach to inferring regulatory networks by leveraging the 100s of genomes now available for many clades of fungi. We use gene orthology as the learning signal to infer interpretable, TF motif-based representations of non-coding regulatory regions, thus scaling comparative genomics beyond evolutionary comparisons where these regions can be aligned.

Zeranols (ZERs) are a class of mycotoxins commonly found in cereals, posing serious health risks, including hormonal disruption and carcinogenic potential. In response to this pressing concern, we have developed a simple yet highly sensitive and high-throughput supramolecular sensing approach based on novel macrocycles known as extended biphen[n]arenes for monitoring ZERs in cereal matrices. The proposed approach utilizes the indicator displacement assay (IDA) and employs quaternary ammonium-functionalized terphen[3]arene (CTP3) as the host molecule for capturing ZERs. This method achieves a highly sensitive response, owing to the robust synergistic interactions between CTP3 and ZERs, ensuring the reliable detection of these harmful compounds.

However, the impact of different tree species in mixed forests on soil aggregate microbial communities remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze the bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition of four soil aggregate sizes (<0.25 mm, 0.25\u20131 mm, 1\u20132 mm, and >2 mm) in pure Castanopsis hystrix plantations (CK), mixed C. hystrix and Acacia crassicarpa plantations (MCA), mixed C. hystrix and Pinus massoniana plantations (MCP), and mixed C. hystrix and Mytilaria laosensis plantations (MCM). The results indicate that (1) establishing mixed forests enhances the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in soil aggregates, and that soil aggregates with size <0.25 mm support higher microbial diversity. (2) The fungal and bacterial composition of soil aggregates in mixed forests differs from that of pure C. hystrix forests. The dominant bacterial phyla in the four forest types are Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The dominant fungal phyla are Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Mucoromycota. (3) PCoA analysis reveals that compared to pure C. hystrix forests, mixing with A. crassicarpa (MCA) results in marked changes in the bacterial community structure of soil aggregates; similarly, mixing with A. crassicarpa (MCA) and M. laosensis (MCM) leads to significant differences in the fungal community structure of soil aggregates. (4) RDA results show that NH4+-N, pH, and OC are the main factors influencing microbial diversity in soil aggregates. In terms of dominant microorganisms, pH and AP are the key environmental factors affecting the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in soil aggregates.

All medical records were reviewed and cases of C. albicans were included. A review of the English literature from the last decade was conducted with a predefined search string. We excluded articles not aligning with our objectives.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong five fungal cases, four were C. albicans infections. Two patients presented with pain/fever in the vertebra column. All were initially treated as having bacterial spondylodiscitis. Half of the patients had positive blood cultures and all had positive biopsies taken. The two remaining patients had experienced candidemia within one year prior to being diagnosed with spondylodiscitis. All were initially treated with fluconazole with a median duration of 9\u2009months (range 6-12\u2009months). The median time to diagnosis was 27\u2009days (range 23-35\u2009days). Two patients died during treatment. The median follow-up was 7\u2009months (range 6-8\u2009months). Thirteen studies were included in the literature review.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe study described the characteristics, treatment and outcome of C. albicans spondylodiscitis patients in Southern Denmark.

Biological control, including the use of entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) and predatory natural enemies, can effectively control aphids. However, there are few reports on the combined use of natural enemies carrying EPF to enhance the efficiency of aphid control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the present study, we evaluated the compatibility of five EPF strains with adults of the Harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis). The pathogenicity, impact on predatory function, and fertility of EPF on H.\u2009axyridis were assessed as indicators, and the control efficiency of the predator carrying EPF was evaluated. The results showed that four EPF strains did not exhibit direct or indirect pathogenicity toward H.\u2009axyridis. Additionally, they did not significantly affect the survival rate, predation function, egg production or hatching rate of adult H.\u2009axyridis. The feeding rate of H.\u2009axyridis on Acyrthosiphon pisum was significantly lower than that of the control group after 0\u2009h of starvation, but there were no significant differences observed following 24 and 48\u2009h of starvation. Under semi-field conditions, the release of H.\u2009axyridis that had been treated previously with Metarhizium rileyi resulted in a significantly higher control of A.\u2009pisum and Rhopalosiphum maidis on Day 4 with aphid mortality rates of 83.33% and 98.35%, respectively. In comparison, the H.\u2009axyridis treatment group exhibited 46.22% and 84.16% mortality, respectively, whereas the M.\u2009rileyi treatment group experienced 10.67% and 61.06%, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFour EPF isolates showed no effect on the survival and predation of adult H.\u2009axyridis. The M.\u2009rileyi treatment had no effect on the reproduction of H.\u2009axyridis, yet H. axyridis adults carrying EPF conidia had a significantly higher control efficiency toward two species of aphids compared to each type of enemy alone. Therefore, predator dissemination of EPF may be an efficient and low-cost strategy for controlling of aphids. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.", "venue": "Pest Management Science", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-03", "authors": [{"authorId": "48242612", "name": "Li Sui"}, {"authorId": "2348332847", "name": "Na Shi"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Qi Yun Li"}, {"authorId": "2250860613", "name": "Yu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2148904147", "name": "Zheng-kun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2146558239", "name": "Yang Lu"}]}, {"paperId": "175730f2d58e5244ccb8bee00422bc285ac7ea40", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1002/cbdv.202500494", "CorpusId": 276751841, "PubMed": "40028936"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/175730f2d58e5244ccb8bee00422bc285ac7ea40", "title": "Asptertides A-H, C13-Polyketides from a Marine-Derived Aspergillus terreus.", "abstract": "In the present study, 11 C13-polyketides comprising a monocyclic skeleton of an aromatic (1-6, and 11) or a cyclohexanone moiety (7), and an oxygenated bicyclic nucleus (8-10), were isolated from a mutated strain of endophytic fungus Aspergillus terreus RA2905.Five pairs of enantiomers (2a/b-5a/b, and 7a/b) were achieved by chiral-phase HPLC separation.

Medical devices, ranging from simple tools like syringes to complex apparatuses such as ventilators, are integral to modern medical care. The common materials used in medical devices are polyethylene, polycarbonate, aluminum, silicone, and plastics. However, their potential to harbor and transmit microorganisms can lead to severe infections and complications if not properly managed. Contamination can occur due to improper handling, insufficient sterilization, and the presence of biofilms on device surfaces. The study aims to review the common microbial contaminants on medical devices. The review suggests that the most frequent contaminants found on medical devices include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida species. Moreover, biofilms can grow on the surfaces of medical devices by a variety of bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, infection risk increases with the length of time a device is utilized. To mitigate these risks, effective reprocessing/cleaning of medical devices is essential. Considering this, the review suggests the many forms of microbial contamination and their connection to medical devices. The study emphasizes the need to follow strict reprocessing, and cleaning protocols to prevent infections and maintain patient safety.

Here, we identified two chromatin modifiers, the histone methyltransferase Dot1 and the Sir silencing complex, as regulators of this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the recombination-promoting axis proteins Red1 and Hop1, but not the axis-associated cohesin Rec8, are significantly reduced within 20 kb of telomeres compared to the chromosome interior. Dot1, which preferentially methylates histones in the chromosome interior, is required for this pattern by directing Red1 binding toward the chromosome interior. In parallel, the Sir complex suppresses the induction of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at chromosome ends. Sir-dependent DSB suppression is independent of axis deposition and occurs in a chromosome end-specific manner that mirrors the spreading and transcriptional silencing activity of the complex, suggesting that the Sir complex suppresses DSB formation by limiting the openness of promoters, the preferred sites of meiotic DSB formation.

This problem can be solved by using a biological method of plant protection, namely microbiological preparations. In our studies, a new biopreparation Y was tested. A stimulating effect of biopreparation Y was revealed after treating spring wheat seeds. Seed germination increased. Due to the antagonistic properties of the bacteria included in the biopreparation Y, seed contamination with microscopic fungi, including phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Bipolaris sorokiniana), is reduced. This biopreparation Y can be used as a seed growth stimulator and their bioprotection from phytopathogenic fungi.", "venue": "\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0435", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "78493110", "name": "\u041b.\u0410. \u0421\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430"}, {"authorId": "89243569", "name": "\u0418.\u041d. \u0413\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0440\u044f\u043d"}, {"authorId": "2348278298", "name": "\u0421.\u0410. \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432"}]}, {"paperId": "9d2daea215d75c9de46f13ca3a46e0d9afdf0cb5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.5817/cpr2024-2-12", "CorpusId": 276763321}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d2daea215d75c9de46f13ca3a46e0d9afdf0cb5", "title": "Urban soil mycobiota and its potential danger for human health in the Subarctic", "abstract": "The quantitative and qualitative parameters of cultivable microfungi communities in urban soils of Subarctic (Apatity, Murmansk region, Russia) were evaluated. In total, 21 species belonging to 11 genera, 10 families, 7 orders, 5 classes, and 2 divisions were distinguished. We determined the proportion of allergenic, toxigenic, and opportunistic microfungi and their potential pathogenicity for humans based on extracellular enzyme activity. The number of microfungi in urban soils varied from 1\u00d7103 to 9\u00d7104 CFU g-1 and was lower than in the forest soil (background) except in the recreational zone. In urban soils, there was a decrease in species diversity compared to forest soil and a significant change in species diversity, as evidenced by the low value of the S\u00f8rensen index (28%). Fungi that pose a threat to human health made up to 85% of the total number of isolated species. The most dangerous genus in urban soil was Aspergillus. An increase in their shares and frequency of occurrence in urban soils compared to the background was found as well. We noted the appearance of dangerous fungi belonging to the RG2 group, an increase in the number of toxigenic (by 15%) microfungi in urban soils. According to the mycological risk index (Im = 6.7-8.4), urban soils were classified as dangerous in Apatity. Microfungal strains with higher extracellular activity of proteinase and phospholipase enzymes than in the background soil were isolated from urban soils. These species also had the ability to grow at human body temperature. Regular monitoring of allergenic, opportunistic and toxigenic fungi in urban soils allows us to assess their potential impact on residents of Northern regions and recommend minimizing contact with the soil and hard road surfaces. This is especially important for preschool children, in order to reduce the likelihood of interaction with opportunistic fungi.", "venue": "Czech Polar Reports", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "14489978", "name": "M.

In this study, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisin, and T-2 toxin concentrations in Trigonella foenum-graecum were determined in feed administered to ruminants and also in blood samples from cattle and sheep in order to evaluate the toxicity correlated to the possible presence of these mycotoxins based on the clinical signs observed in the animals. Analyses of mycotoxins in fenugreek and blood samples were conducted using the enzyme immunoassay KIT. Five extensive farms sited in the northwest of the Sicily region, with a total of 90 intoxicated animals, reported a concomitant unusual outbreak of neurological disorders. Decreased spinal reflex responses, postural abnormalities associated with weakness or recumbency, and hyperesthesia of the limbs suggested a problem regarding the peripheral nervous system.

Integrating biological control with nematophagous fungi, particularly Duddingtonia flagrans, is crucial in addressing worm infestations. Although effective in experiments, the absence of a commercial product has been a limitation. The introduction of Bioverm\u00ae, the first commercial product using D. flagrans in Brazil, marks a significant advancement. This study on a Brazilian sheep farm evaluated a 167-day Bioverm\u00ae treatment, following moxidectin application, focusing on eggs per gram of feces (EPG), FAMACHA score, and sheep weight (WEIGHT). Statistical results showed marked improvements in all parameters after 80 days with Bioverm\u00ae. EPG values gradually declined, demonstrating successful biological control, while FAMACHA increased steadily, stabilizing after 130 days. Minor weight changes indicated effective nutritional management. These outcomes suggest Bioverm\u00ae significantly reduces dependence on chemical anthelmintics and addresses resistance issues. D. flagrans thus emerges as a promising tool for managing nematode infestations without negatively impacting animal weight. This research enhances the understanding of Bioverm\u00ae\u2019s role, confirming its practicality as a viable alternative for helminth control in varied environments, thereby reinforcing its strategic importance in livestock management.", "venue": "Parasitologia", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "2111650712", "name": "P.

This pathogen uses oxalic acid as a virulence factor; for this reason, the degradation of this organic acid by oxalotrophic bacteria has been proposed as a biological control approach. However, previous studies on the potential role of oxalotrophy in biocontrol did not investigate the differential effect of oxalic acid consumption and the subsequent pH alkalinisation on fungal growth. In this study, confrontation experiments on different media using a wild-type (WT) strain of S. sclerotiorum and an oxalate-deficient mutant (strain \u0394oah) with the soil oxalotrophic bacteria Cupriavidus necator and Cupriavidus oxalaticus showed the combined effect of media composition on oxalic acid production, pH, and fungal growth control. Oxalotrophic bacteria were able to control S. sclerotiorum only in the medium in which oxalic acid was produced. However, the deficient \u0394oah mutant was also controlled, indicating that the consumption of oxalic acid is not the sole mechanism of biocontrol. WT S. sclerotiorum acidified the medium when inoculated alone, while for both fungi, the pH of the medium changed from neutral to alkaline in the presence of bacteria.

Compared to the average sales value of 1G ethanol (673.48 USD/m3), the first and second case studies were interesting for their economic viability, while the third case study would require a 43.5% increase in the price of ethanol to achieve production profitability. In the environmental assessment, the integrated 2G ethanol processes of the first and third case studies allowed for the increase in ethanol production per ton of sugarcane processed without decreasing the environmental performance of the process. The third case study presented the lowest environmental impact indicators, except for global warming potential and photochemical oxidation categories, highlighting the importance of the development of biomass pretreatment strategies with lower carbon footprint. The strategy of integrating the 2G process into a 1G ethanol biorefinery offers interesting economic and environmental values, allows the use of hemicellulose, and contributes to the development of 2G processes in sugarcane biorefineries and to the sustainability of the processes.", "venue": "Fermentation", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346483258", "name": "L.

For PLA, degradation peaked under aeration with Penicillium chrysogenum and Bacillus subtilis. PHB/PLA blends degraded slower overall, with maximum degradation under aeration by Penicillium chrysogenum, Pseudoarthrobacter sp., and Flavobacterium sp. Biodegradation was assessed via weight-loss measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal analysis. PHB samples showed reduced crystallinity and thermal stability linked to weight loss, while PLA samples exhibited varied changes, often with increased crystallinity and stability depending on the microorganism.

Velvet dimers control fungal development, virulence and mycotoxin formation. VelB is the only regulator, which carries an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) within the velvet domain. The IDD as well as the positioning within VelB is conserved in the fungal kingdom. Intrinsically disordered regions contribute to transcription activation and DNA binding and frequently appear in eukaryotic transcription factors. The VelB IDD provides selective heterodimerization as well as protein stability control. The IDD is not required for the formation of the VelB-VeA heterodimer of Aspergillus nidulans or Verticillium dahliae, but promotes the formation of the VelB-VosA heterodimer. The IDD destabilizes VelB single molecules and also balances its distribution and ratio between both velvet heterodimers.

Essential oils (EOPA) were extracted by distillation using a Clevenger apparatus, and their phytochemical compounds were identified by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Antioxidant activity tests were carried out using the DPPH and FRAP methods. In addition, antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans to determine its antifungal effect, and against two Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and three Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) to determine the antibacterial effect. The results show that the essential oils contained between 23 and 49 compounds, depending on the extraction area, with (-)-germacrene D as the main compound. Antioxidant activity varied by study area, with IC50 ranging from 0.414 mg/mL (Amghas) to 1.520 mg/mL (Ait Naamane), and EC50 from 2.132 mg/mL to 5.4 mg/mL. In terms of antimicrobial activity, Afourgah essential oils showed the best results, with significant inhibition diameters against bacteria and low MIC. In particular, Amghas essential oils inhibited Staphylococcus aureus well, while Ait Naamane essential oils were less effective. This variability in phytochemical composition, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, may be attributed to climatic differences specific to the distribution zones of the Atlas pistachio tree.

Despite their ecological importance, most VOCs involved as signalling compounds remain uncharacterised. We have previously screened a collection of Actinobacteria strains sourced from Western Australia for their ability in vitro to suppress the growth of plant fungal pathogens. Here we explored the potential of four of the most active strains to produce antifungal metabolites by growing the strains on a range of nutrient\u2010containing media. A casein\u2010based (CYPS) culture medium was found to induce the production of antifungal compounds with high activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a major necrotrophic fungal pathogen of crops such as canola. We further observed that VOCs were produced that influenced pH and affected the bacterium\u2010fungus interaction. The presence of Sclerotinia induced further VOC production in the Actinobacteria. Solid\u2010phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analysis identified 2,4,6\u2010trimethylpyridine, a compound not identified previously from Actinobacteria, which showed antifungal activity against different isolates of S. sclerotiorum and increased the pH of the medium.

Diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase (BioA) catalyses the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid to produce 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, while dethiobiotin synthetase (BioD) catalyses the subsequent step to produce dethiobiotin. In contrast to plants, in bacteria, these activities are catalysed by two separate enzymes, BioA and BioD. Most bacterial BioA enzymes use an unusual amino donor, S-adenosyl methionine, while other BioA enzymes use lysine as the amino donor. We show that the plant BioA uses spermidine as the amino donor.

Aloe vera, a bio-medicinal plant, contains a wide range of phytochemicals such as phenolic, hydroxyl groups, alkaloids, polyols, polysaccharides, etc, which act as reducing and capping agents with high efficiency. This review revealed that aloe vera-derived nanoparticles are safe, stable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly, and they also possess significant applications for drug targeting, disease resistance, tissue engineering, wound healing, anticancer, antibacterial, and cosmetic industries. Synthesized metal nanoparticles are characterized through UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, and the Well-diffusion method. It is highly interesting to note that aloe vera-mediated silver and zinc nanoparticles possess high potency against multi-drug resistant pathogens. Here, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and photocatalytic activity separately showed by aloe vera peel, gel, and leaf, along with possible challenging situations faced during plant extract-based nanoparticle synthesis, are highlighted.

Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Although it has been demonstrated that DON can induce ferroptosis in the liver, the specific mechanisms and pathways are still unknown. The aim of this experiment was to investigate that DON can induce iron metabolism disorders in the livers of mice, thereby triggering ferroptosis and causing toxic damage to the liver. Methods: Male C57 mice were treated with DON at a 5 mg/kg BW concentration as an in vivo model. After sampling, organ coefficient monitoring, liver function test, histopathological analysis, liver Fe2+ content test, and oxidative stress-related indexes were performed. The mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes were also detected using a series of methods including quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence double-labeling, and Western blotting analysis. Results: DON can cause damage to the liver of a mouse. Specifically, we found that mouse livers in the DON group exhibited pathological damage in cell necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, cytoplasmic vacuolization, elevated relative liver weight, and significant changes in liver function indexes. Meanwhile, the substantial reduction in the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the DON group indicated that DON also caused oxidative stress in the liver. Notably, DON exposure increased the levels of Fe2+ and Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver, which provides strong evidence for the occurrence of iron metabolism and ferroptosis disorders. Most importantly, mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2, an important pathway for iron metabolism and ferroptosis, along with its downstream genes, heme oxygenase (HO-1), quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), and solute carrier gene (SLC7a11), were significantly inhibited in the DON group. Conclusions: Based on our results, the Nrf2 pathway is closely associated with DON-induced iron metabolism disorders and ferroptosis in mouse livers, suggesting that maintaining hepatic iron homeostasis and activating the Nrf2 pathway may be a potential target for mitigating DON hepatotoxicity in the future.", "venue": "Metabolites", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346098677", "name": "Haoyue Guan"}, {"authorId": "104198648", "name": "Yujing Cui"}, {"authorId": "2345982164", "name": "Zixuan Hua"}, {"authorId": "2281299672", "name": "Youtian Deng"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Huidan Deng"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Junliang Deng"}]}, {"paperId": "eedd436b10717093163b30b230f91ceeecdc55c2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.ijid.2025.107826", "CorpusId": 276707153}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eedd436b10717093163b30b230f91ceeecdc55c2", "title": "Amplifying the \u2018F\u2019 word: The rise of drug-resistant fungi in Africa", "abstract": null, "venue": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "32573453", "name": "I.

At transplanting, biofertilizers were applied as background fertilizer, compared with an unfertilized control, at a rate of 150g/pack of crushed Rhizophages intraradices; 50g/pack of fresh, well-crushed Azolla filiculo\u00efdes 50g/pack of a mixture of Rhizophages intraradices and Azolla filiculo\u00efdes and 1.5g of NPK in an 8 cm radius around the pepper plant. Growth and production parameters assessed included: collar diameter, number of leaves, plant height, leaf width and length, number of flowers, fruits and mass at harvest. The data obtained were subjected to an analysis of variance with Statistica 7.1 software at the 5% threshold. \nThe results clearly showed that the different treatments had a significant effect on all the growth and production parameters of the pepper plants at the 5% threshold. However, it should be noted that Azolla filiculo\u00efdes had the greatest effect on agromorphological parameters, followed by Rhizophages intraradices, the Rhizophages intraradices-Azolla filiculo\u00efdes combination and, finally, NPK in descending order. \nIn Conclusion, the aquatic fern, Azolla filiculo\u00efdes, appears to be the best biofertilizer likely to improve growth and development in the BIG SUN pepper plant, compared with the mycorrhizal fungus (Rhizophages intraradices).

Root rot is a major issue in S. baicalensis-producing areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indole-3-carboxaldehyde, a metabolite derived from Purpureocillium lilacinum, has a significant effect on Fusarium solani (one of the main pathogenic fungi causing S. baicalensis root rot), and to clarify its antifungal mechanism. We evaluated the toxicity of indole-3-carboxaldehyde to F. solani using the growth rate assay and found that the EC50 value was 59.563 \u03bcg/mL; we also performed additional pot experiments under greenhouse conditions. The effects of indole-3-carboxaldehyde on fungal hyphal morphology and ultrastructure were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Indole-3-carboxaldehyde was found to induce the disintegration of the mitochondrial double membrane in F. solani, as well as cause cell wall separation. Further probing into the effects of indole-3-carboxaldehyde on mitochondrial aspects was conducted using enzyme activity test kits and real-time quantitative PCR. The findings indicated that indole-3-carboxaldehyde decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential; reduces the activities of SOD, CAT, POD, and GR enzymes; and hampers the growth of F. solani by suppressing the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, resulting in H2O2 accumulation. This disruption of the mitochondrial antioxidant pathway impedes the effective clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to the death of F. solani. Future studies of indole-3-carboxaldehyde should focus on its effect on metabolic pathways, which could facilitate the development of innovative pesticides.", "venue": "Horticulturae", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348647611", "name": "Li Wang"}, {"authorId": "2348745887", "name": "Xin Guo"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Lirong Han"}]}, {"paperId": "e7dcf465620df4b24ddc824d3ff63751f794937f", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.apsoil.2025.105923", "CorpusId": 276173156}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7dcf465620df4b24ddc824d3ff63751f794937f", "title": "Ectomycorrhizal fungi explain more variation in rhizosphere nutrient availability than root traits in temperate forests", "abstract": null, "venue": "Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment.

Field experiments are a classic approach for understanding species interactions but are rarely used to study seasonal epidemics. Our research objective was to help fill this gap by manipulating the seasonal timing of the establishment of infectious diseases while tracking epidemics and other ecological responses. To do this, we conducted a multiyear field experiment in an old field in the Piedmont of North Carolina, USA, dominated by the grass species tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb). Darbysh). In the field, tall fescue experienced seasonal epidemics of multiple foliar fungal diseases: anthracnose in spring, brown patch in mid-summer, and crown rust in late summer to fall. In a fully randomized design, we applied four fungicide treatments to replicate plots of intact vegetation in specific seasons to manipulate the timing of disease epidemics. One treatment was designed to delay the establishment of anthracnose until mid-summer, and another to delay the establishment of both anthracnose and brown patch until fall. In a third treatment, fungicide was applied year-round, and, in a fourth treatment, fungicide was never applied. The experiment comprised 64 plots, each 2\u2009m\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009m, surveyed from May 2017 to February 2020. Here, we report a dataset documenting responses in the community structure of both plants and foliar fungi. To track disease prevalence in the host population across seasons and years, this dataset includes monthly leaf-level observations of the disease status of over 100,000 leaves. To quantify transmission and investigate within-host pathogen interactions, we longitudinally surveyed disease status in host individuals of known age at least weekly over two growing seasons. Finally, the dataset includes annual data on infection prevalence of the systemic fungal endophyte Epichlo\u00eb coenophiala, community-level aboveground plant biomass, and plant community cover. These data can be used for meta-analyses, comparisons, and syntheses across systems as ecologists seek to predict and mechanistically understand seasonal disease epidemics.

Leiotrametes menziesii BRB 73 was one of the White Rot Fungi (WRF) that has the potential to degrade dyes. Suitable environmental conditions can optimize dye decolorization results. This study aims to investigate optimal environmental conditions such as time incubation, concentration of dyes, pH, CuSO4, and glucose concentration against decolorization of a mixture of direct dyes and enzyme activity (laccase and MnP). The mixture of commercial direct dyes used contains direct turquoise (DT), direct orange (DO), and direct yellow (DY) dyes. Decolorization was measured using a spectrophotometer at 400-700 nm. Laccase and MnP assay using ABTS and 2.6 DMP as substrate, respectively. The highest decolorization by Leiotrametes menziesii BRB 73 was produced at 54.3% at 96 hours and increased to 67% at a dye concentration of 500 mg.L-1. Meanwhile, the highest laccase and MnP activities were 215 U.L-1 and 39 U.L-1, respectively. pH range was quite wide, ranging from pH 5.5-9, supported by stable MnP activity from pH 3-7. CuSO4 inducers were not required for the decolorization of these dyes. Decolorization was optimal at the addition of 1% glucose, while enzyme activities were 0.5% glucose. Decolorization of dyes by Leiotrametes menziesii BRB 73 was indicated through degradation pathways involving laccase and MnP enzymes.

Results showed that all wheat grain samples contained high levels of AFB1, ranging between (30.0-40.5) \u03bcg/ kg. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that feeding rats with wheat grain samples contaminated by AFB1 for 3 weeks led to significant weight loss and gain enlargement of the liver and kidney of rats, comparing with the control. The quantities of HC and RBC were increased, while the number of WBC was dropped. In addition, the activities of liver enzyme of AST, ALT, and ALP were significantly increased, and the concentrations of kidney marks of urea and creatinine were significantly increased too comparing with the control. Histological analysis showed that liver of control rats exhibited normal morphology. In contrast, the livers of treated rats showed marked disseminated portal fibrosis and congestion, infiltration by inflammatory cells and necrosis. Whereas, kidney of control rats showed typical kidney morphology. While kidney of treated rats showed severe disseminated tubular necrosis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, and disseminated segmental glomerular necrosis. The results confirmed that AFB1 quantities in grains affected seriously on health and made risks through biochemical and histopathological changes in vital organs, liver and kidneys.

This study introduced two anaerobic semi-continuous reactors (ASCR)- R1 and R2 for bioremediation of the rice mill wastewater (RMWW). The alkali treatment of the substrate in reactors R1 and R2 was done by dry NaOH and Ca(OH)2, respectively. Both reactors were loaded with 80% of the RMWW and 20% of the cow-dung-fed biogas plant sludge (BGPS) for 16 days of stabilization at mesophilic temperatures (18\u2103 to 42\u2103). A small amount of jaggery and white rot fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) were also added into both reactors for the bacterial growth and removal of the biorefractory organics (lignin and phenol) present in RMWW, respectively. The impact of variations in the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) upon the anaerobic biodegradation of RMWW was studied in three operating phases (OP) I, II, and III. The highest BOD, COD, lignin, and phenol removal achieved in reactors R1 and R2 were 94%, 92%, 84%, and 82%, as well as 93%, 91%, 82%, and 80%, respectively, in OP I. The highest biomethane yield in both reactors was 0.005 L.g-1 COD in OP II. The results of the three operating phases reveal that a high HRT and low OLR give the maximum pollutant removal efficiency and the highest biomethane yield. The novelty of this research paper is the significant removal of the biorefractory organics lignin and phenol from the RMWW with the help of white rot fungi and specific bacterial strains Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter sp., Actinomycetes sp. and Streptomycetes sp. present in the inoculum.

This study aimed at assessing the antifungal activities of crude extracts obtained from leaf, stem bark, and roots of Calotropis procera against the fungal pathogens Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Fusarium solani. The stems, roots, and leaves of the selected plant species were shade-dried and ground to powder, and the bioactive components were extracted using ethanol (99.5%), hexane (99.8%), and distilled water. The antifungal activity of the extracts against the three selected pathogens were evaluated using the agar-well diffusion method and inhibitory zones were measured in millimeters at four different concentration levels (30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/ml). Carbendazim and sterile distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Among the selected plant materials, stem bark extracts showed the highest yield (10.45%) in ethanol crude extracts, whereas, the lowest yield (1.45%) was for water crude extract from the roots. The bioassay studies revealed that the crude extracts of ethanol, hexane and water had antifungal activity on all three fungal species at all concentrations and with all solvents. Ethanol extracts had the highest growth inhibitory effects as compared to those of the hexane and water crude extracts. In this study, the selected solvent crude extracts had fewer antifungal activities than carbendazim. A. niger, F. oxysporum, and F. solani growth was highly affected by ethanol leaf extract as compared with hexane and water extracts. Conversely, stem bark hexane extract showed higher antifungal activity only against F. oxysporum.

These materials are prone to mycotoxin contamination, as mycotoxigenic fungi infest crop plants in the field and agricultural products during storage. As mycotoxins can cause toxic effects in aquatic animals, their occurrence in feedstuffs should be monitored. To this end, we performed an extensive global survey of mycotoxin contamination in aquaculture feed and plant-based feed raw materials. We collected samples of compound feed for fish (n = 226) and shrimps (n = 61), maize (n = 3448), maize DDGS (n = 149), wheat (n = 1578), soybean (n = 428), and rice (n = 65). We analyzed concentrations of 51 mycotoxins, emerging mycotoxins, masked mycotoxins, and mycotoxin metabolites. Mycotoxins were almost ubiquitously present in compound feed, as >90% of samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin. Feed raw materials exhibited distinct mycotoxin occurrence patterns consistent with known susceptibility to fungal pathogens and with their production process. Unsafe concentrations of aflatoxin B1 exceeding the EU maximum level were detected in 7.2% of fish feed samples. While most feedstuffs complied with EU guidance values for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and fumonisins, a comparison of detected concentrations with dietary concentrations reported to cause adverse effects in fish and shrimps in published studies indicated that significant fractions of samples contained potentially harmful levels of these mycotoxins. In addition to regulated mycotoxins, several emerging mycotoxins (e.g., enniatins, beauvericin, alternariol, moniliformin) were prevalent. Feed was frequently co-contaminated with multiple mycotoxins indicating a risk of combined effects. In conclusion, mycotoxin contamination was common in aquaculture feed and fractions of samples were contaminated with mycotoxin levels known to exert adverse effects in aquaculture species. Results of this survey highlight the necessity for targeted studies on the effects of frequently detected mycotoxin mixtures and emerging mycotoxins in fish and shrimp.", "venue": "Toxins", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "1398920221", "name": "C.

Hydrocarbons are a major source of pollution in the environment and have an impact on agriculture, aquatic life, and soil fertility. The necessity of resolving this issue is highlighted by the detrimental impact on soil biocenosis and the potential conversion of soils into technogenic deserts. Due to high costs and polluting byproducts, the conventional approach of treating contaminated soil, sediment, and water is unsustainable. However, bioremediation, which makes use of biological agents like fungi and bacteria, appears to be a more practical and affordable solution. Microbial biosurfactants present a possible solution for environmental restoration due to their less harmful nature compared to chemical surfactants. This review highlights the green and sustainable nature of microbial biosurfactants while examining their advancements, biotechnological potentials, and future possibilities for bioremediation. The review also looks at the genetic basis and economic viability of biosurfactants for bioremediation applications. Furthermore, the review emphasizes the need for more studies in overcoming the challenges of large-scale application of biological surfactants for bioremediation of pollution and environmental restoration. As partners in nature, these bacteria aid in the breakdown of hydrocarbons, highlighting the need for industry and the environment to coexist sustainably.

The quantification of biologically active substances (BAS) was performed using spectrophotometric, titrimetric, and HPLC analysis methods. Antioxidant activity was measured through a potentiometric method, while antimicrobial effects were assessed using the well diffusion method and determined the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC). The total content of phenolic compounds was 0.54% and 10.10%, organic acids \u2013 4.60 and 1.60% for blackberry fruit thick and green tea leaf extract. The total content of catechins in the green tea leaf extract was 10500.0 mg/100 g, where epicatechin-3-O-gallate was dominated (3730.0\u00b12.00 mg/100 g). The total content of anthocyanins in the blackberry fruit thick extract was 159.81 mg/100 g, where cyanidin-3-Oglucoside was dominated (134.56\u00b10.10 mg/100 g). Both extracts possessed a high antioxidant potential, and effective antimicrobial effects. The antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-fungi activity of blackberry fruit extract was higher than green tea leaf extract. In addition, we assumed that anthocyanins had higher antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-fungi properties than catechins.

In this study, field severe wilt infection in bread wheat was observed in January 2021 in the wheat field of the Muradia Agriculture Station, Babylon, Iraq. Disease symptoms on the roots were observed as brown discoloration and root rot. Pathogen isolation, morphological characterization, pathogenicity, and sequencing of ITS, TEF1-\u03b1, TUB2, and ACT regions, and the phylogenetic analysis with multi-gene of the isolated pathogen were performed. The results obtained revealed that the multigene phylogenetic trees using Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis in addition to morphological characteristics confirmed the identification of Fusarium annulatum. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood trees based on only ITS sequences and ITS data was not sufficient to distinguish this species among Fusarium spp. However, the results of phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood trees based on TEF1-\u03b1 region or multigene phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates of F. annulatum were grouped in a distinct species clade belonging to the Fusarium spp. This work is considered as the first molecular identification using 3-gene phylogenetic analysis and first report of F. annulatum as a wheat pathogen in Babylon, Iraq.\n\nKeywords:\n\nFungal disease, Triticum aestivum, multigene phylogenetic analysis, Fusarium, soil borne disease.", "venue": "Arab Journal for Plant Protection", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347589352", "name": "F.R.H.

A total of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group (35 \u03bcL saline) and SOM group (35 \u03bcL PA LPS), with 10 rats in each group.

Levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- \u03b1, and transforming growth factor (TGF)- \u03b2 in serum were detected. The residual amount of Albumin-FITC and the expression of ZO-1 , Occludin , and VE-cadherin were detected in stria vascularis tissues.

These enzymes facilitate the yeast's ability to infect the keratinised outer layer. The incidence of fungal infections has increased in recent years due to increasing resistance to antifungal agents and the limited availability of antifungal treatments, which are often associated with numerous side effects.\u00a0 \nYeasts belong to important genera classified in the phylum Deuteromycotina (Imperfect Fungi). They are single-celled, eukaryotic organisms that reproduce asexually by budding. They lack a sexual phase and have oval cells with a diameter of 3 to 6 micrometres. Yeasts can occur as single cells or form pseudohyphae in host tissues where they develop germ tubes - a precursor to invasion of host tissues.\u00a0 \nColonies are smooth, soft, white to yellowish in colour and often give off a yeasty odour. Due to the absence of chlorophyll, yeasts exhibit nutritional heterogeneity and dimorphism, allowing them to grow in either hyphal or yeast form depending on environmental conditions.\u00a0 \nThe species Candida albicans is one of the most important pathogenic yeasts responsible for candidiasis, a fungal infection that can be primary or secondary and is caused by different species within the genus Candida. The infection can be acute, subacute or chronic, causing localised lesions in the mouth, throat, skin, vagina, fingers, nails and trachea. In some cases, the infection can spread systemically, affecting the lungs and gastrointestinal tract (Dignani et al, 2009).", "venue": "European Journal of Ecology, Biology and Agriculture", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2323987892", "name": "Sarah omran Rasheed"}]}, {"paperId": "87dfde3d8c024e05a656f21652d1a90cd61418d3", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.eimce.2025.02.007", "CorpusId": 276767188, "PubMed": "40038028"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87dfde3d8c024e05a656f21652d1a90cd61418d3", "title": "Severe invasive pulmonary aspergillosis caused by 2 different species of Aspergillus.", "abstract": null, "venue": "Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia Clinica", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "CaseReport"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2271996990", "name": "Javier Romero L\u00f3pez"}, {"authorId": "2254299723", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda de Lomas Guerrero"}, {"authorId": "2329645046", "name": "Jes\u00fas Lancha Dom\u00ednguez"}, {"authorId": "81467662", "name": "F.

The World Health Organization has established a priority list highlighting critical multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens that demand urgent research on antimicrobial treatments. Considering this and the fact that new antibiotics are only sporadically approved, natural antibacterial agents have seen a resurgence in interest as potential alternatives to conventional antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. Natural antibacterials, derived from microorganisms, higher fungi, plants, animals, natural minerals, and food sources, offer diverse mechanisms of action against MDR pathogens. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of antibacterial agents from natural sources, including a brief history of their application and highlighting key strategies for using microorganisms (microbiopredators, such as bacteriophages), plant extracts and essential oils, minerals (e.g., silver and copper), as well as compounds of animal origin, such as milk or even venoms. The review also addresses the role of prebiotics, probiotics, and antimicrobial peptides, as well as novel formulations such as nanoparticles. The mechanisms of action of these compounds, such as terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds, are explored alongside the challenges for their application, e.g., extraction, formulation, and pharmacokinetics. Conclusions: Future research should focus on developing eco-friendly, sustainable antimicrobial agents and validating their safety and efficacy through clinical trials. Clear regulatory frameworks are essential for integrating these agents into clinical practice.

G-quadruplexes (G4s), four-stranded secondary structures that form in DNA and RNA, have arisen as a drug target to treat bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. Here, we provide the first demonstration that G4s form in fungi and represent a promising new target for antifungal development. We found that PhenDC3 and pyridostatin (PDS), ligands that bind to and stabilise G4s, potently inhibited the metabolism of fungal pathogens in different ways. These pathogens included the pan azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolate TR34/L98H and Candida auris. Notably, PhenDC3 could synergise with amphotericin B, was protective in an in vivo model of fungal infection, and was well-tolerated by human cells. However, continuous exposure to PhenDC3 resulted in some cross-resistance to current antifungals and this needs to be explored further. PhenDC3 could also increase the number of RNA G4s in live A. fumigatus.

However, the industry faces the challenge of Ganoderma infection, a destructive disease affecting oil palm trees that causes base stem rot (BSR). To address this issue, a novel method is proposed for detecting Ganoderma disease in oil palm trees by combining hyperspectral imaging and machine learning techniques. In this paper, four different classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree (DT), were trained on a tabular dataset generated by clustering spectral signatures of each pixel in the hyperspectral image. The evaluation results show that the MLP model showed 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing between healthy and infected trees. SVM with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels show the second highest performance, attaining 91.67% accuracy, 83.33% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. Before training on classifiers, a feature-based band alignment technique is developed to overcome the hyperspectral image misalignment issue and ensure the accuracy of the spectral data. The developed band alignment significantly improved spectral coherence across the adjacent bands, as proved by enhanced Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) values. Additionally, the developed background subtraction method effectively extracted the tree pixels from the background, resulting in a high precision score of 93.99%. Future research will focus on collecting more data, incorporating temporal information for disease stage classification, and implementing a more robust machine learning (ML) model for performance enhancement. Overall, this research shows the great potential of hyperspectral imaging for accurate detection of Ganodermadisease in oil palm plantations.\u00a0Doi: 10.28991/HEF-2025-06-01-05 Full Text: PDF", "venue": "Journal of Human Earth and Future", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348600785", "name": "Chee Seng Kwang"}, {"authorId": "2255475150", "name": "Siti Fatimah"}, {"authorId": "2255477832", "name": "Abdul Razak"}, {"authorId": "26954926", "name": "S.

In the tropics, forest conversion to agriculture is occurring alongside warming and more pronounced periods of drought. Rainfall after drought induces enormous dynamics in microbial growth (potential soil carbon storage) and respiration (determining carbon loss), affecting the ecosystem carbon budget. We investigated how legacies of drought and warming affected microbial functional (growth and respiration) and structural (16S and ITS amplicon) responses after drought. Rain shelters and open\u2010top chambers (OTCs) were used to simulate drought and warming in tropical cropland and forest sites in Ethiopia. Rain shelters reduced soil moisture by up to 25\u2009vol%, with a bigger effect in the forest, while OTCs increased soil temperature by up to 6\u00b0C in the cropland and also reduced soil moisture but had no clear effect in the forest. Soils from these field treatments were then exposed to a standardized drought cycle to test how microbial community traits had been shaped by the different climate legacies. Microbial growth started increasing immediately after rewetting in all soils, reflecting a resilient response and indicating that microbial communities perceived the perturbation as relatively mild. Fungi recovered faster than bacteria, and the recovery of fungal growth was generally accelerated in soils with a legacy of drought. Microbial community functions and structures were both more responsive in the cropland than in forest soils, and a legacy of drought particularly enhanced microbial growth and respiration responses in the cropland but not the forest. Microbial communities in cropland soils also used carbon with a higher efficiency after rewetting. Together, these results suggest contrasting feedbacks to climate change determined by land use, where croplands will be associated with mitigated losses of soil carbon by microorganisms in response to future cycles of drought, compared to forests where soil carbon reservoirs remain more sensitive.", "venue": "Global Change Biology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "28343658", "name": "L.

The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of grain borne fungi on farmer saved sorghum cultivars at pre-and post-harvest value chain. Using direct-plating technique, four fungi genera and 12 species were identified in sampled sorghum grains from farmers and experimental plots. The influence of moisture content (MC) is crucial in growth and development on grain surfaces. Prevalent fungi isolated and identified from the grains were Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp. and Rhizopus spp. An analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that 30% of the tested samples revealed B1 and B2 strains of aflatoxin.

Crop residue quality depends on plant physiology which governs the process of decomposition in the soil. Quality index determines the decomposability of the crop residue which is used to predict the efficiency of its application in the soil. Therefore, there is a need to study the chemical composition of plants and ensure their decomposition process. The present study attempts to establish a formulated approach to select quality crop residues for re-usage in soil. The study was conducted in the agriculture farms of Kedarpur village in Dehradun district, (Uttarakhand 30.2672\u00b0 N, 78.0465\u00b0 E) in 2016-17. The soil type of the area is sandy loam. Four major crops (wheat, rice, sugarcane and maize) were selected to analyze their qualitative potential to generate a quality index. Residue production ratio (RPR), agricultural ecological potential (AEP), and, gross residue potential (GRP) values were determined to correlate their decomposition pattern with nutrient release rate. GRP showed the availability of residue generated by crops was highest in wheat. AEP further implied that 48% of wheat and maize crop residue should be left on the field to maintain ecological services. While it was found to be less than 30% in the case of rice and sugarcane. The C: N ratio was found highest in the order of sugarcane>maize>rice>wheat, which implies that the residual properties of wheat are the most favourable for fast decomposition. The effects of PRQI on the microbial load of the soil were studied. It was observed that crop residues with low PRQI under decomposition were weighed down by a higher number of fungi than bacterial colonies. The results are studied in coherence to explain the ecological importance of retaining crop residues in the field. The chemical parameters integrated as plant residue quality index (PRQI) further confirm the high nutrient value of wheat and rice crop residues correlated with their higher decomposition rate. The present study implies that the decomposition rate of crop residues can decide their retain value depending on the nutrient release rate, it would establish the link between residue decomposition and crop growth. The use of agricultural ecological potential could prove to be an important tool to evaluate the amount of residue required for performing ecosystem services. PRQI can further be utilized to determine the relationship between crop residue decomposition rate and crop growth performance.", "venue": "Journal of Scientific Research and Reports", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348122300", "name": "Richa Rajput"}, {"authorId": "2348167515", "name": "Bhagyashree Debbarma"}, {"authorId": "2136170906", "name": "Himshikha Gusain"}, {"authorId": "2348193767", "name": "Vaishnavi Sharma"}]}, {"paperId": "6667032195717910a19e4cd10bdfe291c659b08c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s13205-025-04236-2", "CorpusId": 276732014, "PubMed": "40041691"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6667032195717910a19e4cd10bdfe291c659b08c", "title": "The role of statistical methods in optimizing and enhancing fungal chitosan commercial production.", "abstract": null, "venue": "3 Biotech", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "1518539960", "name": "Bhoomika M.

Cylindracin is a small cysteine-rich protein that is specifically expressed in the immature fruiting body of the edible mushroom Cyclocybe cylindracea. Recombinant protein (rCYL), comprising the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of cylindracin, inhibits the hyphal growth and conidiogenesis of filamentous fungi. Here, we show that rCYL represses the egg-laying and development of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The feeding of rCYL at 16 \u00b5M reduced the body volume of C. elegans larvae to approximately 60% when compared to the control. At the same concentration, rCYL repressed the frequencies of pupation and emergence of D. melanogaster to 74% and 40%, respectively, when compared to the control. In virgin adult flies, feeding of rCYL at 47 \u00b5M substantially repressed the frequency of egg-laying, and the pupation and emergence of the next generation, especially for females. These inhibitory effects of rCYL gradually disappeared after ceasing the ingestion of rCYL. The use of fluorescence-labeled rCYL revealed that the protein accumulates specifically at the pharynx cuticles of C. elegans. In D. melanogaster, fluorescence-labeled rCYL was detected primarily in the midguts and to a lesser degree in the hindguts, ovaries, testes, and malpighian tubules. rCYL was stable against trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, whereas it did not inhibit proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes in vitro. rCYL oligomerized and formed amyloid-like aggregates through the binding to heparin and heparan sulfate in vitro.

The results show that field warming experiments significantly modify soil temperature (+1.8\u00b0C), soil water content (-3.2%), and soil pH (-0.04). However, field warming does not significantly alter the diversity, richness, and community structure of soil bacteria and fungi. Warming-induced changes in soil variables (i.e., \u0394Soil water content, \u0394pH), \u0394Temperature and experimental duration are important factors influencing the microbial responses to warming. In addition, soil bacterial \u03b1-diversity (Shannon index) decreases significantly (-3.4%) when the warming duration is 3-6\u2009years, and bacterial \u03b2-diversity increases significantly (35.2%) when warming exceeds 6\u2009years. Meta-regression analysis reveals a positive correlation between the change of bacterial Shannon index and \u0394pH. Moreover, warming produces more pronounced effects on fungal Shannon index and \u03b2-diversity in experimental sites with moderate mean annual temperature (MAT, 0\u00b0C-10\u00b0C) than in higher (>\u200910\u00b0C) or lower (<\u20090\u00b0C) MAT. Overall, this study provides a global perspective on the response of soil microorganisms to climate warming and improves our knowledge of the factors influencing the response of soil microorganisms to warming.", "venue": "Global Change Biology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["MetaAnalysis", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2144671200", "name": "Xudong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2338346097", "name": "Wenao Wu"}, {"authorId": "119793017", "name": "Gukailin Ao"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Mengguang Han"}, {"authorId": "2348367104", "name": "Mengli Liu"}, {"authorId": "2348353420", "name": "Rui Yin"}, {"authorId": "3409118", "name": "Jiguang Feng"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Biao Zhu"}]}, {"paperId": "505c28580d3123ebe331a4f616b713e688252853", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.mtcomm.2025.112093", "CorpusId": 276761465}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/505c28580d3123ebe331a4f616b713e688252853", "title": "Design of Co-culturing system of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi for potential application in self-healing concrete", "abstract": null, "venue": "Materials Today Communications", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2160893643", "name": "Nisha Rokaya"}, {"authorId": "2304554401", "name": "Erin C.

The processing generates a large amount of waste and causes environmental issues. In order to reduce the environmental impacts, several approaches for the waste management of citrus fruits were proposed. The citrus fruit waste contains several functional compounds, but the extraction of these functional compounds requires adequate production facilities. The waste is not suitable to carry for long distances due to the high percent of water content and its heavy weight, and it is not suitable to store for a long time due to the occurrence of fermentation. Some of the approaches target the use of waste in the proximity of the processing factories. The application of citrus fruit waste for crop production in the agricultural fields close to the faculties is one of the possible management options. The evidence of citrus fruit waste as herbicidal, nematocidal, insecticidal, and anti-fungal materials has been accumulated in the literature over three decades. Several compounds involved in these functions have also been identified in the citrus fruits. However, there has been no review article focusing on the pesticidal activity of citrus fruits against weeds, herbivore insects, parasitic nematodes, and pathogenic fungi.

Solid waste such as sawdust is primarily produced by the forestry industry and although it is utilized by certain countries as briquettes to make fire or as an absorbent to clean fluid spillage as well as a component of ceilings, most of the sawdust along the Lagos Lagoon in Nigeria is left unattended as waste, contributing to environmental pollution. Cellulose, composed of glucose units is a structural component of sawdust and when saccharified the resulting glucose can be fermented into renewable substances such as bio-ethanol. The cellulose degradation process can be performed with a cellulase enzyme such as available in the fungus Aspergillus niger and during the current investigation, this enzyme system was used to bio-convert the cellulose component of sawdust from ten different trees along the Lagoon into glucose. To increase the cellulase action all sawdust materials were delignified before cellulase action with the main aim of determining the optimum pH value for maximum degradation of the various sawdust materials. The pH-related saccharification profile of each type of sawdust was constructed as well as the relative percentage of saccharification and it was concluded that all the materials were optimum degraded at acidic pH-values which varied between pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 that are like optimum pH-values reported for the other types of cellulose materials.", "venue": "Nature Environment and Pollution Technology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "89556566", "name": "N.

This research assessed the morpho-agronomic, physiological, and gene expression responses of two Passiflora cincinnata accessions (tolerant and sensitive) to water deficit, focusing on their relationship with mycorrhization. A randomized design with two accessions, two field capacities, and four AMF inoculation treatments was used to compare drought and control conditions. Differential gene expression was analyzed under drought stress, and the effect of mycorrhization on stress tolerance was evaluated. The results showed that inoculation with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities, especially those from water-deficit conditions (AMF25), resulted in greater increases in height, number of leaves, stem diameter, number of tendrils, leaf area, and fresh biomass of root and shoot, with increases ranging from 50% to 300% compared to the control (non-inoculated) and monospecific inoculation (Entrophospora etunicata). Higher photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency were observed in the tolerant accession. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased the total chlorophyll content in both accessions, especially when inoculated with native AMF communities. Overall, P. cincinnata showed higher mycorrhizal responsiveness when inoculated with native AMF communities compared to monospecific inoculation with E. etunicata. The tolerant accession showed overexpression of the genes PcbZIP, PcSIP, and PcSTK, which are associated with signal transduction, water deficit tolerance, osmoregulation, and water transport. In contrast, the water deficit-sensitive accession showed repression of the PcSIP and PcSTK genes, indicating their potential use for distinguishing tolerant and sensitive accessions of the species. The tolerance of P. cincinnata to water deficit is directly related to physiological responses, increased photosynthetic rate, efficient water use, and regulation of gene expression.", "venue": "Stresses", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2266569637", "name": "Luiz Victor de Almeida Dantas"}, {"authorId": "2213650558", "name": "Roberta Lane de Oliveira Silva"}, {"authorId": "2215761982", "name": "Welson Lima Sim\u00f5es"}, {"authorId": "2265278236", "name": "Adriana Mayumi Yano-Melo"}, {"authorId": "152454516", "name": "N.

We report the first case of CLIA complicated by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in a patient with schizophrenia.

The patient, diagnosed with treatment\u2010resistant schizophrenia, was started on clozapine, but 9 months later he presented with fever, cough, leukopenia, and neutropenia.

In the present study, lotus root starch (LRS) was co-fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. The effects of single- and mixed-strain fermentation on the structure, physicochemical properties and digestibility of starch were investigated at different fermentation times.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that cracks and grooves appeared on the surface of fermented LRS, particularly with prolonged mixed fermentation. Additionally, the particle size, dissociation, freeze-thaw dehydration shrinkage and hydration characteristics of starch significantly decreased. Structural characterization showed that fermentation promoted the alignment of LRS long chains towards shorter sequence structures, enhanced hydrogen-bonding interactions and increased the relative crystallinity of LRS by degradation of the amorphous region. Mixed fermentation also increased the viscosity, springiness, thermal stability and shear stability of LRS gels compared to single fermentation, effectively improving the digestive performance.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study has confirmed that co-fermentation with L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae significantly influences both the multiscale structure and physicochemical properties of LRS. These results provide promising strategies for processing and nutritional enhancement of fermented lotus root products. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.", "venue": "The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2303795128", "name": "Yu-Ting Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2276367066", "name": "Yu-Hang Jiang"}, {"authorId": "1491500557", "name": "Weizhi Xin"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Ming Liang"}, {"authorId": "2329428596", "name": "Jia-Jia Song"}, {"authorId": "2339023808", "name": "Chen Wang"}, {"authorId": "2339425269", "name": "Xiao-Yong Chen"}, {"authorId": "2276282498", "name": "Hua-Yi Suo"}]}, {"paperId": "14c59c2ccab8a0c2d68a90f1706ed2bf45f9034f", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.36348/sjmps.2025.v11i03.001", "CorpusId": 276802134}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14c59c2ccab8a0c2d68a90f1706ed2bf45f9034f", "title": "Biodiversity of Salt-adapted Filamentous Fungi of Red Sea Coast in Upper Egypt", "abstract": "Extremophiles are organisms that can thrive under extreme environmental conditions.

The work analyzes strains of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Saccharomyces and other genera. Methods for obtaining probiotics are considered, including the selection of producer strains, the scheme and parameters of culturing producers, collection and concentration, lyophilization, formulation of the product composition, selection of the dosage form. Following technological methods for obtaining dosage forms of probiotics are used: capsules, emulsions, hydrogels, suppositories, tablets, etc. \nResults. The main functions of probiotics in various parts of the human body are considered. Bacterial strains that are part of prophylactic and medicinal preparations are analyzed. The creation of new probiotic preparations is carried out in several directions: the creation of recombinant microorganisms by genetic engineering methods and the development of new generation therapeutic preparations to improve human health, as well as the development of probiotic delivery systems into the human body. Engineered probiotics are a type of new microorganisms obtained by modifying the original bacteria and yeast. The possibility of using a new generation of strains (Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bromii, etc.) that demonstrate high therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases is discussed. New data and a deep understanding of the microbiome have helped to identify useful commensals and their therapeutic potential. The prospects for the use of probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics in preparations, including a new generation of probiotic strains, are shown. The effectiveness of probiotic products for restoring the microflora of the oral cavity, intestines and vagina in various dosage forms was assessed: hydrogels, capsules and tablets. \nConclusions. Functional products of probiotic and postbiotic origin have antiviral, antibacterial and antitumor activity.

Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 110 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the placebo group. A chi-square test of baseline characteristics confirmed no significant differences in age or sex distribution between the two groups. Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, the intervention group exhibited significantly lower levels of total cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alongside significantly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), compared to the placebo group, with all differences reaching statistical significance. Furthermore, the relative percentage changes in lipid parameters also demonstrated significant intergroup differences. Safety analyses revealed that the intervention had no notable effects on renal function parameters, whereas hepatic function parameters showed statistically significant improvement in the intervention group. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that GLSO extract effectively improved lipid profiles and liver function, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Chicken manure (CM) and rice husk (RH) were used as organic raw materials for composting. The basic physicochemical analysis indicated that the combined addition of Trichoderma harzianum and Phanerochaete chrysosporium effectively improved lignin degradation rate (16.60%), increased humic acid (HA) content (22.70\u202fg/kg), and the germination index (GI) reached 110.99%.

High-quality diet is one of influencing factors of sarcopenia, particularly important for muscle mass and function. This study aims to examine the dietary patterns of community-dwelling older adults in a typical region of China and explore the relationship between these dietary patterns and sarcopenia.We used data of the Nutrition and Health Follow-up Study of the Chinese Population in 2021. Food frequency questionnaires were used to obtain food items intake frequency during the last year. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), muscle strength and physical performance were assessed according to the Asian Sarcopenia Working Group (AWGS2019) criteria. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between dietary patterns and sarcopenia.A total of 1,967 participants over the age of 65 were included in the study, and the prevalence of sarcopenia was 17.0%. According to the factor loadings of all of the 18 food groups, three dietary patterns were identified. These dietary patterns include the diversified dietary pattern, which is mainly characterized by the intake of soybeans, fungi and algae, animal meat, fruits, and legumes; the traditional dietary pattern, which is mainly defined by the consumption of rice, pork, poultry, vegetables, and aquatic products; and the wheat-based dietary pattern, which is mainly characterized by the intake of wheat, tubers, and other cereals. The diversified dietary pattern (OR\u202f=\u202f0.54, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and the traditional dietary pattern (OR\u202f=\u202f0.51, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were linked to a lower risk of developing sarcopenia, whereas the wheat-based dietary pattern (OR\u202f=\u202f3.54, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) was associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia.

No further concerns were raised relating to identity. The ACAF concluded that the additive is safe for the target species, the consumer and the environment. The additive is not an irritant to skin or eyes but should be treated as potentially harmful if inhaled and as a potential skin sensitiser. Upon receipt of further information relating to the inclusion rate of the additive, the ACAF concluded that the inclusion of the additive demonstrates similar effects on performance parameters when compared to vitamin D3. The Committee therefore concluded that the additive is effective in raising serum/plasma 25-OH-D3 levels in comparison with vitamin D3 for ruminants when used according to the proposed conditions of use.

The aim of the study was to establish the distribution of FDR in Russia and to reveal the species diversity of fungi causing this disease. In 2018\u20132024, tuber analysis of 342 potato batches obtained from various regions of 5 Federal Districts of the Russia was carried out. The share of batches with FDR and the occurrence of the tubers with disease symptoms were assessed, and Fusarium fungi were isolated from these tubers, followed by identification of them based on the morphological and cultural characteristics. It was found that 82.7 % of the analyzed potato batches contained tubers infected with Fusarium fungi, the proportion of which varied from 5.7 to 13.5 %. Potato yield of 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024 can be characterized as a relatively low-infected by FDR, the frequency occurrence of tubers with disease symptoms did not exceed 6.5 % on average, whereas in 2018 and 2019, high potato infestation was noted \u2013 15.3\u201320.5 % of tubers.

This systematic review updates current knowledge on the efficacy of various antagonistic microorganisms in controlling Foc, considering the recent spread of this disease to new regions. The studies were systematically analyzed, focusing on methodologies, results, and conclusions to provide a comprehensive overview of current research and its practical implications. A total of 118 studies were reviewed, covering the use of antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., Streptomyces spp., and Pseudomonas spp., both in pure cultures and in consortia. Most studies focused on controlling Foc TR4 in Cavendish subgroup bananas and originated from Asia. Microbial consortia demonstrated a higher control percentage with lower variability, particularly in genera such as Pseudomonas. In contrast, pure cultures were more commonly used for Streptomyces. The choice between consortia and pure cultures depends on the genus and the experimental context, as each approach has distinct advantages. Although the reviewed studies were generally of high quality, long-term research is still lacking. Antagonistic microorganisms represent a promising alternative for Foc control, although their efficacy depends on the specific strain and environmental conditions. It has been observed that inoculating these microorganisms onto seedlings before transplantation or in combination with organic matter enhances their effectiveness. Localized testing and formulation optimization are recommended to improve their application as preventive and suppressive tools in soil against infections. The review highlights a vast diversity of microbial agents with high efficacy rates, various modes of action, and additional benefits for plant development beyond Foc biocontrol. Furthermore, some studies achieved 100% control at the plant level under controlled conditions. These findings demonstrate that biological control is a viable alternative for integrated Foc management.

Environmental hazards, such as chemical exposure, pollution, and toxins, have significant adverse effects on both human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective intervention strategies. Method: A systematic review was conducted by searching three major databases\u2014PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge\u2014using specific keywords related to environmental hazards, settings, health impacts, and nursing interventions. It synthesizes findings from studies published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on environmental health, exposure prevention, risk assessment, and health education. \u00a0The selection of papers adhered to the PRISMA guidelines to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant literature. Results: The review highlights the widespread impact of environmental hazards, including pollutants like PFAS, pesticides, and microplastics, which contribute to health issues such as respiratory diseases, developmental disorders, and cancer. Additionally, studies reveal the importance of environmental nursing in managing these risks, with interventions such as admission screenings for infections like Candida auris and the integration of experiential learning in health curricula to enhance community health education. Community health nursing and health education play pivotal roles in promoting awareness and preventing diseases by targeting social and environmental determinants of health. Conclusion: This review underscores the importance of multi-faceted nursing interventions in addressing environmental health risks.

Interest in actinomycetes has become prevalent around the world because of their ability to generate several beneficial bioactive metabolites. In the present study, 32 marine soil samples were collected from Tyre City Beach, Lebanon, in different seasons. A total of 10 actinomycetes species were identified and characterized depending on their microscopic features. All isolates were tested for their potential to exert antimicrobial activities against varied microorganisms using cross-streak and agar well diffusion methods. All isolates displayed significant antimicrobial activities against the tested indicator microorganisms. Similarly, all 10 isolates of marine actinomycetes exhibited antifungal activity in cross-streak tests against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. Moreover, the optimum conditions used to enhance the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites against Bacillus cereus were tested for the three isolates Kocuria rosea, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces longisporoflavus.

However, there is a severe lack of knowledge regarding interactions in the plant-soil-microbiome continuum, and specifically root-soil interface traits including the role of root hairs. Here, we investigated how water limitation propagates in a plant-soil-microbiome system upon stopping irrigation. We used two Zea mays genotypes (rth3 and its isogenic wildtype B73), differing in root hair formation, to elucidate the effect of rhizosphere extension under water limitation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFor 22 days, WT and rth3 were grown in a climate chamber, with irrigation stopped for drought treatment during the last 7 days. Daily measurements included soil water status, plant evapotranspiration and gas exchange. At harvest, root exudates, shoot relative water content, osmolality and nutrients, root morphological traits and transcriptomics, and soil microbial \u03b2-diversity and enzyme activity were determined.\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nIn line with a larger plant size, drought stress developed more rapidly and the number of differentially expressed genes was higher in the WT compared to rth3. Under water limitation, root exudation rates increased and soil enzyme activities decreased more strongly in the WT rhizosphere. In both genotypes, water level significantly altered microbial \u03b2-diversity in the bulk soil, particularly affecting fungi more than bacteria/archaea. The genotype affected only bacteria/archaea and was more pronounced in rhizosphere than in bulk soil.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis interdisciplinary study assessed how a short drought stress manifested in a plant-soil-microbiome system. Water limitation altered microbial (fungal) diversity more distant from the root surface. Genotype-specific stress-induced increases in exudation rates modified microbial activity in root proximity, possibly pointing to root hair functions under water limitation. Less intense drought responses of rth3 were confirmed at all levels of investigation and may be due at least in part to its smaller plant size.", "venue": "Annals of Botany", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "2185582719", "name": "R.

Lithocholic acid (LCA) exhibits various pharmacological activities. RNA-seq and ChIP-qPCR analysis were used in the current study to investigate the protective mechanism of LCA for DON-induced inflammatory Responses via Epigenetic Regulation of DUSP5 and TRAF5 in porcine ileal epithelial cell lines (IPI-2I) cells. The IPI-2I cells were treated with the vehicle group, 250\u202fng/mL DON, 20\u202f\u03bcmol/L LCA, 250\u202fng/mL DON+ 20\u202f\u03bcmol/L LCA for 24\u202fh could induce inflammatory Responses via Epigenetic Regulation of DUSP5 and TRAF5 in IPI-2I cells. By analyzing the transcriptional profiles of DON and LCA-treated IPI-2I, we observed significant transcriptional changes in IPI-2I cells. Further analysis of up-and down-regulated differential genes revealed the enrichment of pathways closely related to inflammation and apoptosis, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, IL17 signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway. An upregulated (p <\u202f0.05) relative mRNA expression level of RAP1B, GDNF, FGF2, IL1R1, RAPGEF2, DUSP5, TGFB3, CACNA1G, TEK and RPS6KA2 were noted in IPI-2I exposed to DON.

The case study of Colletotrichum associated with ferns", "abstract": "The genus Colletotrichum comprises numerous fungal species with diverse ecological roles, including plant pathogenic, endophytic, and saprophytic lifestyles. Accurate species identification is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions, disease epidemiology, and fungal ecology. However, taxonomic classification within Colletotrichum remains challenging due to genetic complexity and phenotypic plasticity. Conventional approaches such as single-gene analyses and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) frequently fail to resolve closely related taxa, leading to misidentifications that hinder species delimitation and comparative evolutionary studies. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers a promising alternative by providing genome-wide resolution for phylogenetic analysis. This study investigates Colletotrichum isolates associated with the fern Rumohra adiantiformis and evaluates the effectiveness of WGS in addressing taxonomic uncertainties.A total of 18 Colletotrichum isolates, including fern-associated strains, were analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. High-quality genome assemblies were generated, and gene prediction was conducted using AUGUSTUS. Orthogroup assignment and phylogenomic analysis were performed based on single-copy orthologs, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using MLST and WGS-based approaches. Comparative analyses were carried out to assess the taxonomic resolution provided by WGS in relation to traditional methods.Genome-wide phylogenomic analysis revealed distinct evolutionary lineages among Colletotrichum isolates that MLST failed to resolve, highlighting host and geographic differentiation. High-quality genome assemblies were obtained, with 98.3% of genes assigned to orthogroups, indicating strong genomic conservation. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed a close relationship between Rumohra adiantiformis-associated isolates and Colletotrichum filicis, reinforcing the effectiveness of WGS in species identification.These findings demonstrate the superiority of WGS over MLST in resolving species boundaries and reconstructing evolutionary relationships. The enhanced resolution provided by genome-wide data enables more accurate taxonomic classification, reducing misidentifications and improving our understanding of fungal biodiversity. By refining Colletotrichum taxonomy, WGS facilitates ecological and pathogenic studies, offering a robust framework for future research in fungal systematics and plant pathology. As sequencing technologies continue to advance, WGS is expected to become a standard tool for fungal species delineation and evolutionary studies.", "venue": "Frontiers in Fungal Biology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348002135", "name": "Andrea Menicucci"}, {"authorId": "2347998435", "name": "Salvatore Iacono"}, {"authorId": "2348304924", "name": "Madalena Ramos"}, {"authorId": "2325360561", "name": "Chiara Fiorenzani"}, {"authorId": "2258610663", "name": "Natalia A.

In this study, we described a new fungal taxon under Trematosphaeriaceae, based on root endophytic fungi recovered from the desert plant Gymnocarpos przewalskii in Gansu Province, China. The taxon is characterised by simple, aseptate conidia and pycnidia in unusually small sizes. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis, based on ITS, LSU, SSU and TEF sequences and a morphology study indicated that the taxon represented a new genus within the Trematosphaeriaceae and was named Nigromargarita tarda. Intriguingly, an intron of 355 bp in length located at site 453 on the ribosomal SSU gene was detected in one strain of N. tarda. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the intron belongs to an intron position class (Pcl) restricted to Pleosporales. Phylogeny affiliated distribution of this Pcl was confined at the genus or lower level, suggesting a horizontal transmission pattern of this Pcl.

As\nglobal consumption of meat and animal-based products continues to rise, it is contributing to profound environmental changes.\nThese shifts underscore the need for innovative solutions, such as alternative proteins, to mitigate the ecological impact of\ntraditional agricultural practices and support the development of more sustainable food sources for the growing global\npopulation (Happer & Wellesley, 2019). A growing number of environmentally aware individuals have adopted the \"Go Green\"\nmovement, which promotes the creation of plant-based foods. These foods provide various health advantages and are also\ncrucial for safeguarding the environment and promoting animal welfare. (Xiao et al., 2023). Plant-based foods, often referred to\nas alternative proteins, are sourced from plants and present a promising opportunity to lower carbon emissions and reduce the\nneed for animal farming. These proteins produce fewer greenhouse gases and demand fewer resources for their production\n(Munialo, 2023). As the name suggests, alternative proteins act as replacements for traditional animal-derived proteins,\naddressing the rising demand for more sustainable and eco-friendly food options. They offer important benefits for individuals\nfollowing vegan diets by providing comparable nutrients to those found in animal-based products. Sources of plant-based\nproteins include cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and other alternatives such as fungi, air protein, insects, and myofibrils, all of which\nare viable substitutes for animal meat (Vallikkadan et al., 2023). In particular, alternative proteins, often derived from plants,\nare obtained from legumes, nuts, grains, fungi, algae, and yeast. As healthcare continues to improve globally and life expectancy\nincreases, the demand for these alternative proteins has surged. Among the most common alternatives are single-celled\norganisms like yeast and algae. Additionally, insects, which offer a similar amino acid profile to conventional animal proteins,\nare consumed by approximately 2 billion people worldwide. Other sources of alternative proteins include lentils, wheat protein,\nlegumes, chickpeas, fish protein, chicken protein, and eggs, all of which are rich in essential amino acids that support cellular\nfunctions, metabolism, growth, and immune system health. The shift toward plant-based and cultivated meats not only brings\nhealth benefits but also plays a crucial role in reducing the environmental damage caused by traditional animal meat\nproduction. These animal-free ingredients aim to mimic the taste, texture, and quality of eggs, dairy, and seafood, providing\ncleaner, more ethical, and sometimes even healthier alternatives (Surya Ulhas et al., 2023; Quintieri et al., 2023).", "venue": "International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "2340111579", "name": "Karren Mehrotra"}]}, {"paperId": "abfd5dd8d0743dc3c66044ad61423783b9d2ebd8", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s12665-025-12158-8", "CorpusId": 276719247}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abfd5dd8d0743dc3c66044ad61423783b9d2ebd8", "title": "The effect of Mg immissions on the accumulation of nutrients and risk elements in soils and macromycetes", "abstract": null, "venue": "Environmental Earth Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "86996232", "name": "M.

This scoping review aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the role of C. auris infection in carcinogenesis and its associated risk factors. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive search of three databases was conducted from January 2003 to January 2024 to identify studies addressing the role of C. auris infection in cancer development and its associated risk factors. A total of 124 articles were identified, of which six met the inclusion criteria. These studies reported the risk factors associated with C. auris infection in cancer patients. The findings showed an increased susceptibility of cancer patients to C. auris infections. However, to date, no direct relationship has been reported between C. auris infection and cancer development due to the limited accuracy of diagnostic tools.

The Researchers in this research investigated how AMF influences the growth rate and fruiting performance of Pleurotus ostreatus in this study. The current mushroom supply levels are insufficient to meet worldwide demand especially in Nigeria since mushrooms mainly come from imported sources. Therefore, yield increases become necessary. Food security may be achieved by increasing the overall mushroom mycelia yield due to the effects of AMF on plant yield. The research explored yield effects from using four (4) different types of AMF. Glomus gigaspora, Glomus clarum, Glomus mosseae, and Glomus derserticola belong to the group of AMF being studied. Mushroom producers utilized sawdust along with calcium carbonate and rice bran as their growth substrates. The researchers calculated the Biological Efficiency (B.E.) that reflected mycelia yield levels. The AMF Glomus clarum had the highest yield with 938.33\u00b135.92g with B.E. of 62.55\u00b12.9%.

However, despite the crucial role pathogens play in species distribution, our understanding of how geographical factors influence disease susceptibility remains limited. This investigation explored the effects of latitudinal clines and biomes on disease resistance using the common fly pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae and 43 global Drosophila melanogaster populations. The findings revealed correlations between disease resistance and latitudinal gradients of sleep duration, temperature, and humidity. Although enhanced defenses may be driven by fungal diversity at tropical latitudes, the most disease\u2010resistant tropical males also showed the highest susceptibility to desiccation. This suggests potential trade\u2010offs between abiotic stress resistance, necessary for survival in temperate habitats, and disease resistance. Furthermore, the study uncovered interactions between sex, mating status, sleep, and abiotic stresses, affecting disease resistance. Notably, longer\u2010sleeping males and virgin flies survived infections longer, with additional daytime sleep post\u2010infection being protective, particularly in the most resistant fly lines. These observations support the hypothesis that sleep and disease defense are intertwined traits linked to organismal fitness and subject to joint clinal evolution.", "venue": "Ecology and Evolution", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347894203", "name": "Mintong Nan"}, {"authorId": "2253853378", "name": "Jonathan B.

Our previous studies revealed four OxdC-encoding genes in the whole genome, with CsOxdC3 playing important roles in morphosporogenesis, fungicide resistance and virulence in Colletotrichum siamense. Here, we systematically analyzed the biological functions of four oxalate decarboxylase genes in C. siamense via a loss-of-function method. The results revealed CsOxdC1, CsOxdC2, and CsOxdC4 played major roles in degrading oxalic acid in C. siamense, whereas CsOxdC3 did not. All four CsOxdCs positively modulated morphosporogenesis, including vegetative growth, conidial size, conidial germination rate and the appressorium formation rate, to different extents. In particular, the CsOxdC3 deletion mutant failed to form appressoria. The four OxdC gene deletion mutants had different responses to Mn2+, Cu2+, and multiple fungicides. Among them, CsOxdC2 and CsOxdC4 exhibited positive roles in resistance to Mn2+ and Cu2+ stresses; CsOxdC1 played a slightly positive role in C. siamense resistance to azole fungicides; and CsOxdC3 had a significantly positive role in regulating the sensitivity of C. siamense to multiple fungicides, including pyrrole and azole, but not CsOxdC2 and CsOxdC4. Furthermore, compared with the wild-type strain, \u0394CsOxdC2 and \u0394CsOxdC3, but not \u0394CsOxdC1 and \u0394CsOxdC4, displayed significantly reduced virulence.

Different microorganisms and enzymes were individually added to 500 g of Caragana korshinskii, and anaerobic fermentation was carried out in an incubator at 40 \u00b0C for 14 days. The results show that compared to the control group (CK) without any additives, the sensory evaluation of all treatments improved, with the L + Y + D + M treatment being the best (p < 0.05). All treatments reduced the contents of acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and tannin (p < 0.05), while increasing the content of crude protein and relative feeding value (p < 0.05), with the L + Y + D + M treatment showing the most significant effect (p < 0.05). Lactic acid levels significantly increased (p < 0.05) and the pH significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in all treatments, with the L + Y + D + M treatment outperforming the other treatments (p < 0.05). The L + Y + D + M treatment increased the abundance of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Weissella (p < 0.05), significantly reduced harmful microbial abundance and diversity (p < 0.05), and improved the microbial community structure in silage. In summary, the addition of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Y), tannase-producing bacteria (D), cellulase (M), and their combined treatment (L + Y + D + M) can promote the silage-related characteristics of Caragana korshinskii, with the L + Y + D + M treatment performing better compared to the other treatments.

Aflatoxin exposure causes growth failure, immune suppression, and liver cancer. While several systematic reviews have assessed the link between aflatoxin exposure and growth development in humans, there is a lack of reviews on the associations between aflatoxin exposure and micronutrient levels/status. This review addresses that gap by compiling studies on the association between aflatoxin exposure and micronutrient levels/status in humans. Methods: A comprehensive search of the SCOPUS, PUBMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted, focusing on studies published between 2003 and 2023. Only English-language studies using urine, blood, serum, or plasma biomarkers were included to assess the exposure and outcomes. The risk of bias in these studies was evaluated using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria for human studies. Results: Ten observational studies were included in the systematic review, which collectively reported the association between aflatoxin exposure and haemoglobin, zinc, and vitamin A, E, and C levels. This review suggests that aflatoxin exposure is associated with micronutrient deficiencies, such as anaemia (low haemoglobin levels (<11 g/dL)) in pregnant women and vitamin A deficiency in adults and children. Conclusions: This review highlights the link between aflatoxin exposure and micronutrient deficiencies, emphasizing the need for aflatoxin mitigation within micronutrient interventions. Future studies should focus on longitudinal and interventional research to establish causal relationships and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the interaction between aflatoxin exposure and other potential confounding factors such as dietary patterns, socioeconomic status, and genetic predisposition.", "venue": "Nutrients", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "121951031", "name": "N.

HIV infection alters the human virome, and virome perturbations have been linked to neurocognitive issues in people without HIV. Once thought to be sterile, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hosts a recently discovered virome, presenting an unexplored avenue for understanding brain and mental health in PWH. This cross-sectional study analyzed 85 CSF samples (74 from PWH on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 11 from controls without HIV, CWH) through shotgun metagenomics for DNA/RNA viruses. Taxonomic composition (reads and contigs), \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity, and relative abundance (RA) of prokaryotic (PV), human eukaryotic (hEV), and non-human eukaryotic viruses (nhEV) were evaluated in relation to HIV infection, markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, cognitive functions, and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analyses and post-hoc cluster analysis on the RA of viral groups and blood-brain barrier permeability were also performed. Of 46 read-positive CSF samples, 93.5% contained PV sequences, 47.8% hEV, and 45.6% nhEV. Alpha diversity was lower in PWH versus CWH, although p>0.05. At \u03b2 diversity analysis, HIV status explained 3.3% of the variation in viral composition (p=0.016). Contigs retained 13 samples positive for 8 hEV, 2 nhEV, and 6 PV. Higher RA of PV was correlated with higher CSF S100\u03b2 (p=0.002) and \u03b2-Amyloid 1-42 fragment (\u03b2A-42, p=0.026), while higher RA of nhEV with poorer cognitive performance (p=0.022). Conversely, higher RA of hEV correlated with better cognition (p=0.003) and lower \u03b2A-42 (p=0.012). Sensitivity analyses in virome-positive samples only confirmed these findings. Three CSF clusters were identified and showed differences in astrocytosis, \u03b2A-42, tau protein, and cognitive functions. Participants with hEV-enriched CSF showed better cognitive performance compared to those with virus-devoid and nhEV-enriched CSF (models\u2019p<0.05). This study provides the first comprehensive description of the CSF virome in PWH, revealing associations with neuroinflammation and cognition. These findings highlight the potential involvement of the CSF virome in brain health and inform about its composition, origin, and potential clinical implications in people with and without HIV. Author Summary HIV can affect brain health and mental well-being, even in people on successful antiretroviral therapy. The reasons behind this are still unclear. HIV also influences the communities of microbes and viruses living in the human body, and recent research suggests that the human virome, the collection of all viruses within the body, may play a role in cognitive functions, mood, and brain health. For a long time, scientists believed that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds the brain, was sterile, while robust evidence has shown that the CSF hosts its own unique virome. Via advanced genetic sequencing (shotgun metagenomics), we analyzed the CSF virome in people with and without HIV looking for possible links to neuroinflammation, cognitive performance, and depression. We found that while HIV infection does affect the composition of CSF viral communities, there were no remarkable differences in the CSF virome of individuals with and without HIV. Most viral sequences appeared to come outside the brain. A higher abundance of non-human viral sequences, such as viruses of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, was associated with neuroinflammation and poorer cognitive performance. On the other hand, a higher abundance of human viruses correlated with better cognitive function and healthier signature of neuromarkers. These findings provide new insights into the presence and characteristics of the human CSF virome and how it might influence brain health. They also suggest new potential mechanisms of HIV-associated neuropathology.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "4308829", "name": "M.

We compared the genomes of 12 plant-pathogenic Saccharomycotina strains to 360 plant-associated strains to identify features unique to the phytopathogens. Characterization of the oxylipin synthesis genes, a compound believed to be involved in Eremothecium pathogenicity, did not reveal any differences in gene presence within or between the plant-pathogenic and plant-associated strains. A reverse-ecological approach, however, revealed that plant pathogens lack several metabolic enzymes known to assist other phytopathogens in overcoming plant defenses. This includes L-rhamnose metabolism, formamidase and nitrilase genes.

The gene was subsequently cloned and its function was investigated. The ZmPR5 gene comprises an open reading frame of 525 base pairs, encoding a protein of 175 amino acids. ZmPR5 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and the ZmPR5EMS mutant in maize, and they were subjected to q-PCR and measurements of antioxidant enzyme activities (POD, SOD, CAT, MDA), electrical conductivity, and chlorophyll content. The results indicate that the expression of ZmPR5 is up-regulated upon infection by Fusarium verticillioides, with significant differences observed in the activities of POD, SOD, CAT, MDA, electrical conductivity, and chlorophyll content. The study found that ZmPR5 is localized in the nucleus and interacts with Zm00001d020492\u00a0(WRKY53) and Zm00001d042140 (glucA).

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma guizhouense, whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability.

The applicant seeks renewal of the additive for use in poultry for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening, lactating sows and laying hens, as well as an extension of use of the additive in all poultry species and all pigs (Suidae). In addition, the applicant seeks authorisation for the new use concerning use of an improved production strain, substituting strain A. oryzae DSM 26372 with A. oryzae DSM 33700. To support the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) in evaluating the dossier, the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF) were asked to review the dossier and the supplementary information from the applicant. The FSA/FSS concluded, based on the ACAF\u2019s advice, that the additive was fully identified and characterised. It was concluded that RONOZYME\u00ae WX (CT and L), manufactured with the A. oryzae DSM 33700 strain, did not raise any safety concerns regarding the genetic modification of the production strain. Members concluded positively on the stability and homogeneity of the additive. However, the pelleting stability for RONOZYME\u00ae WX (CT) was only tested for 20 seconds, and therefore this should be made clear on the label as some of the uses may require longer conditioning times. The additive is considered safe for the target species, the consumer and the environment. The additive RONOZYME\u00ae WX (CT and L) is not a skin irritant and RONOZYME\u00ae WX (L) is not an eye irritant. RONOZYME\u00ae WX (CT) is a potential eye irritant. No information on skin sensitisation was provided; therefore, the additive is regarded as a potential skin sensitiser. The additive should be classified as a respiratory sensitiser due to the proteinaceous nature of its active ingredient (enzyme). It was concluded that the additive is efficacious in all poultry species and in all pigs (Suidae) at a minimum recommended level of 100 Fungal Xylanase Units (FXU)/kg and 200 FXU/kg complete feed, respectively, with the exception to gestating sows, as no data was provided.

Certain types of fungi are capable of producing a toxic organic compound called mycotoxin. The mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus is known as aflatoxin. The mushroom growth medium that is often used is SDA (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar). The composition of SDA media is peptone mycology, sugar, agar. The content of rice bran is carbohydrates, protein, water, and agar. The purpose of the study was to determine the comparison of growth diameter and effectiveness of Aspergillus flavus\u00a0 concentration on bran filtrate media with various concentration variations. The method used in this study was experimental with inoculation of Aspergillus flavus fungi with a single dot method. The average colony diameter concentrations of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% were 5.3 mm, 8.4 mm, 11.4 mm, and 16.5 mm. On SDA media\u00a0 the average colony diameter is 17.6 mm.

This study integrates multiple publicly available databases to construct an ITS sequence database encompassing 93,975 fungal species, making it a resource with broader species diversity for fungal taxonomy. In this study, a fungal classification model named FungiLT is proposed, integrating Transformer and BiLSTM architectures while incorporating a dual-channel feature fusion mechanism. On a dataset where each fungal species is represented by 100 ITS sequences, it achieves a species-level classification accuracy of 98.77%. Compared to BLAST, QIIME2, and the deep learning model CNN_FunBar, FungiLT demonstrates significant advantages in ITS species classification.

It is noted for extensive recalcitrant infections and high rates of terbinafine resistance that are changing treatment paradigms for tinea infection.\n\n\nAIM\nTo report on the epidemiology of dermatophyte infections from the National Mycology Reference Laboratory at Auckland City Hospital and the arrival of T. indotineae in New Zealand.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective review of laboratory data from January 2017 to August 2024. Antifungal susceptibility was performed by disc testing. Species identification was performed by phenotypic methods and for a limited number of isolates by DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 961 dermatophytes identified. Trichophyton rubrum was the most common species, accounting for 72% of all isolates. There were 85 (9%) confirmed or probable T. indotineae identified from 63 individuals. These included both Auckland isolates and isolates referred from laboratories around the country. Of the 49 T. indotineae isolates that had antifungal susceptibility testing performed, only 30 (61%) were susceptible to terbinafine, while 45 (92%) were susceptible to itraconazole.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTerbinafine resistant T. indotineae has arrived in New Zealand.

It is necessary for the synthesis of important molecules, as vitamin D, but it is harmful to organisms leading to photoaging and skin cancer. Artificial sunscreens prevent these harmful effects, but may be carcinogenic and neurotoxic; also they accumulate in the aquatic ecosystem, harming the environment and leading to coral bleaching. Most artificial sunscreens commercialized are fossil fuel derived and produced by the petrochemical industry. As society turns to bioeconomy, these artificial sunscreens may be substituted by sustainable ones. Algae, cyanobacteria and fungi produce mycosporines and mycosporine-like aminoacids, which absorb UV radiation and dissipate it as heat. They are a natural source of sunscreen with low or no toxicity and can be produced by biotechnological means; therefore, the aim of this study is to search for mycosporine biosynthesis in yeast from an extreme environment.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nchromatographic and spectroscopic data analyses demonstrated for the first time an isolate of Naganishia friedmannii, collected from a site with high UVR incidence, is able to produce mycosporine-glutaminol-glucoside (MGG) and its likely diastereoisomer, when exposed to PAR-UVR light. A biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the N. friedmannii genome and shown to be induced in response to UVR by Real-Time PCR.

Differential expression of mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) was analyzed at 3 and 5 days post-Fg inoculation (dpi).The results showed that WY exhibited a targeted miRNA response, primarily modulating defense-related pathways such as glutathione metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which are crucial for oxidative stress regulation and pathogen defense response. In contrast, CS displayed a broader transcriptional response, largely linked to general metabolic processes rather than immune activation. Notably, the up-regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and immune defense in WY confirmed its enhanced resistance to FHB. The integrated analysis of miRNA-mRNA interactions highlighted miRNAs as central regulators of defense mechanisms in WY, particularly at later stages of infection. These miRNAs targeted genes involved in immune responses, while lncRNAs and circRNAs played a more limited role in the regulation of defense responses. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses further revealed that WY enriched for plant-pathogen interaction and secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, which are crucial for pathogen resistance. In contrast, CS prioritized metabolic homeostasis, suggesting a less effective defense strategy.Overall, this study underscores the critical role of miRNA-mediated regulation in FHB resistance in WY.

The samples were counted and analyzed according to the methodology of V. S. Pustovoit All-Russian Research Institute of Oil Crops. It was established that agrotechnical methods had no effect on the mycological composition of the sunflower rhizosphere, contributed to the decrease of plant affection and positively influenced the growth and productivity of the crop. The application of fertilizers and chemical plant protection against diseases contributed to a 10 % decrease in the prevalence of sunflower dry rot (Rizopus spp.), an increase in plant height by 8.1 cm and the achievement of a high yield \u2013 1.25 t/ha. Decreasing the seeding rate from 75 to 65 thousand pcs/ha resulted in a significant increase in the thousand-seed weight from 53.6 to 57.3 g. The best laboratory germination of seeds (98.0 %) was obtained with the combined use of biological plant protection and microfertilizers, field germination (95.4 %) \u2013 with the use of fertilizers and chemical plant protection.

In an attempt to highlight lineages of fungi that are distinct from the most speciose subphylum Dikarya (Ascomycota + Basidiomycota), the terms \"early diverging fungi [lineages]\" and \"basal fungi\" have been introduced, typically to refer to any phylum of fungi outside Dikarya. However, these terms are problematic, because they implicitly assume that the traits and taxa outside of Dikarya are ancestral by invoking a \"ladder of progress.\" A simple rearrangement of the tree to deemphasize the species-rich Dikarya shows that the logic that these taxa are \"early branching\" or \"basal\" is a fallacy, because it ignores two facts: (i) that all extant lineages of fungi have evolved an equivalent amount of time since a last common fungal ancestor, and (ii) that the \"early diverging lineages\" are no more related to each other than they are to Dikarya. To support the many mycologists who want to celebrate the understudied lineages outside of Dikarya while ensuring that these lineages are not mistakenly perceived as \"less evolved,\" \"more ancient,\" or of \"lower complexity,\" we propose that the community abandon these terms and simply use formal taxonomic names, e.g. Mucoromycota.

Saccharification of the alga crude fiber followed by microbial fermentation improves protein bioaccessibility and leads to products of higher protein content and quality. Also, upon fermentation, the nutritional and bioactive properties of these feed ingredients are enhanced, since microorganisms synthesize vitamins, new proteins, and essential amino acids. The carbohydrate fraction of Ulva rigida was hydrolyzed into a sugar-rich syrup and subsequently used as a substrate in microbial fermentations. Three types of fermentation were tested, namely, with a consortium of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB), with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and with a co-culture of lactobacilli and yeast. A functional analysis of lyophilized whole-fermentation broths revealed that the yeast-fermented products had stronger antioxidant properties when compared to the LAB-fermented products.

This review provides a detailed exploration of microbial contaminants in industrial wastewater, including bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae), viruses (Hepatitis A, Norovirus), protozoa (Cryptosporidium, Giardia), and fungi, highlighting their sources, proliferation factors, and associated health risks. Emerging health threats, such as waterborne disease outbreaks, the rise of antibiotic-resistant microbes, and their disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, are critically examined. Advanced detection and monitoring techniques, including culture-based methods, molecular tools like qPCR, biosensors, and metagenomic analyses, are discussed for their role in improving pathogen surveillance. Factors influencing microbial proliferation, such as temperature, pH, chemical composition, and seasonal variations, are explored to underscore the complexity of microbial dynamics in wastewater systems. Mitigation strategies, including primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment technologies, advanced oxidation processes, and disinfection methods such as chlorination, UV radiation, and ozone treatment, are evaluated for their effectiveness. The role of policy frameworks and international guidelines in promoting safe wastewater management is highlighted. The review also emphasizes the growing importance of nature-based solutions, such as constructed wetlands and green infrastructure, in achieving sustainable wastewater treatment. Future directions are outlined, including the integration of innovative microbial control technologies, real-time monitoring through AI and IoT, and policy innovations to foster international collaboration. This work concludes that addressing microbial contamination requires a multi-faceted approach involving technological advancements, policy development, and public education. Recommendations are made to prioritize real-time monitoring, capacity building, and the adoption of nature-based and advanced treatment technologies.

Patients typically acquire this infection through environmental exposure, so reducing B. pseudomallei levels in the environment could mitigate the risk of infection. Trichoderma asperellum is a biological control agent that synthesizes a diverse range of antimicrobial substances targeting other microorganisms. This study therefore examined the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of T. asperellum culture filtrate against B. pseudomallei. Methods The antibacterial activities of T. asperellum culture filtrates, collected at various time intervals, were assessed against B. pseudomallei using the agar well diffusion method. Subsequently, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and anti-biofilm activities of the culture filtrate exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect were determined. Bactericidal efficacy was further evaluated via a time-kill assay. The mechanisms underlying inhibition were then investigated using scanning electron microscopy and crystal violet uptake assays. Results Filtrate collected from 7-day old cultures of T. asperellum (TD7) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on B. pseudomallei, with an inhibition zone of 30.33 \u00b1 0.19 mm. The MIC of TD7 against B. pseudomallei was 7.81 \u00b1 0.00 mg/mL and the MBC ranged from 7.81 \u00b1 0.00 to 11.72 \u00b1 1.75 mg/mL. Time-kill studies with TD7 confirmed its bactericidal activity, with complete elimination of B. pseudomallei occurring within 30 min treatment at 62.48 mg/mL (8xMIC) and 24 h treatment at 7.81 mg/mL (1xMIC). At a concentration of 7.81 mg/mL, TD7 also significantly reduced B. pseudomallei biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed surface roughening and cell shrinkage of TD7-treated B. pseudomallei. TD7-treated bacteria were also found to absorb more crystal violet dye than untreated cells, indicating that TD7 might inhibit and kill B. pseudomallei by disrupting cell membrane permeability. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that T. asperellum culture filtrates possess bactericidal activity and effectively disrupt biofilm formation by B. pseudomallei. This suggests that T. asperellum could potentially be used to reduce the presence of B. pseudomallei in the environment and, consequently, lower the incidence of melioidosis.", "venue": "PeerJ", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "2203811198", "name": "Naritsara Roopkhan"}, {"authorId": "12678785", "name": "Thotsapol Chaianunporn"}, {"authorId": "6394214", "name": "Sorujsiri Chareonsudjai"}, {"authorId": "2174400551", "name": "Kanokporn Chaianunporn"}]}, {"paperId": "0f1dc2e7d463b86d8af93a1adb827919fdf69082", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s00247-025-06193-7", "CorpusId": 276670609, "PubMed": "40019500"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f1dc2e7d463b86d8af93a1adb827919fdf69082", "title": "Pediatric non-congenital central nervous system infections: role of imaging in the emergency department.", "abstract": null, "venue": "Pediatric Radiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-28", "authors": [{"authorId": "1403942716", "name": "C.

About 80% of females worldwide have encountered candida albicans, the root cause of vaginal candidiasis [VC]. This infection is manifested by inflammation, itching, erythema, dyspareunia, and pain in the infected vaginal mucosal area. Long-term use of antibiotics, immunosuppressants, contraceptive pills, use of intra-uterine devices, vaginal douching, unprotected sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and hyperglycemic condition are the major factors that affect vaginal flora and may cause VC. Conventional dosage forms, such as creams, ointment, powder, pessaries, etc., are used in VC treatment; however, they have some serious limitations, such as short mucosal contact, rapid vaginal flush or discharge, or poor mucosal absorption. Researchers have developed several novel hydrogel preparations, such as mucoadhesive, pH or temperature-sensitive, or other polymeric hydrogels, to overcome these limitations. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide information on the pathophysiology and diagnosis of VC, and recently developed hydrogels for its treatment, which utilize a sol-gel system where gel formation takes place in vaginal conditions.

Along with the benefits, limitations, challenges, and suggestions for bio-fertilizers (Produced from food wastes) application in Brunei Darussalam were subsequently outlined. The literature search was limited to 2009 to 2024, using relevant keywords to extract information from online databases such as Scopus, Mendeley, Science Direct, Elsevier, and Google Scholar.

This review revealed that food wastes such as eggshell wastes, washed rice water, fruits, vegetables, and animal wastes have positive effects on improving soil and crop productivity. Bio-fertilizers provide many benefits in terms of environment, socio-economic, soil and crop productivity and disease resistance. The few limitations of bio-fertilizers are heavy metal contents, low macro-nutrient content, and large quantities required for field application. These limitations can be further researched to improve the accessibility and quality of bio-fertilizer production. Currently, the implications of organic bio-fertilizers (Produced from food wastes) in Brunei Darussalam are limited because of a lack of information and awareness on bio-fertilizer use.

Optimizing (heterologous) gene expression via codon usage or tRNA preference alone may yield suboptimal outcomes. In this study, we present a comprehensive mechanistic model that accounts for the competition of tRNAs at the ribosomal A-site, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequence interactions, and the decelerating effects of positively charged peptide patches. Our model offers a holistic perspective on the effects of translational elongation, including growth rate-dependent variation in translational rates by 22 to 25% between slow- and fast-growing Escherichia coli cells. We emphasize that endogenous E. coli sequences typically adapt to these effects, particularly in highly expressed genes, where adaptation ensures efficient translation. Conversely, heterologous gene sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are predicted to exhibit lower translational elongation rates by 14 to 70% compared to the homologous isoform. Simulated elongation profiles not only underscore potential sites for translation engineering but also suggest feasible synonymous codon exchanges. The implications of our model extend beyond mere codon usage adaptation and shed light on the key factors influencing translation efficiency (e.g., codons for positively charged amino acids reduced elongation rates by \u223c6%).

It originates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and depending on the organism, it is produced by different biosynthetic routes. The basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis synthesizes itaconic acid via isomerization of cis-aconitic acid to trans-aconitic acid, and subsequent decarboxylation catalyzed by the trans-aconitate decarboxylase Tad1, which belongs to the aspartase/fumarase superfamily. Since no other decarboxylase has been identified within this protein superfamily, Tad1 constitutes a novel type of decarboxylase. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of Tad1, which, together with mutational analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements, provide insight into the molecular mechanism of Tad1-dependent decarboxylation. Specifically, our study shows that decarboxylation is favored in acidic conditions, requires protonation as well as migration of a double bond, and coincides with structural rearrangements in the catalytic center. In summary, our study elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying a novel type of enzymatic decarboxylation and provides a starting point for protein engineering aimed at optimizing the efficient production of itaconic acid.", "venue": "PNAS Nexus", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Liujuan Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2348756298", "name": "Wei Li"}, {"authorId": "2191736913", "name": "Marvin Christ"}, {"authorId": "47181590", "name": "N.

Due to the increased antibiotic resistance of uropathogens and their regional variation, monitoring pathogen distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility is important to ensure effective antibiotic therapy. This retrospective study analyzed the 3-year-long uropathogen profiles and their resistance from a single tertiary general hospital (single-center) and 28 hospitals (multi-center) to provide data allowing guidance for appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment for UTI.A total of 26,108 non-repetitive clinical urine isolates from the single-center during 2017\u20132019 and the multi-center in 2018 were collected, the pathogen and antimicrobial resistance profiles were analyzed.Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the top five bacterial pathogens for both the multi-center and single-center, while the proportion of Candida albicans was higher in the single-center. E. coli was the most resistant species, with resistance rates exceeding 50% for 13/30 of the antibiotics tested, even exceeding 80% for ampicillin, nalidixic acid and piperacillin. Particularly, the resistance rates of E. coli to cefazolin were 62.7% in the multi-center while exceeding 90% in the single-center. Similarly, the resistance rates of K. pneumoniae were approximately 40%\u202f~\u202f60% to 16/29 of the antibiotics tested in the single-center, compared to 30%\u202f~\u202f50% in the multi-center. In enterococci, E. faecium showed the resistance rates exceeding 90% for 6/10 of the antibiotics tested, while E. faecalis was highly resistant to erythromycin (> 66%) and tetracycline (> 81%). The main fungal pathogens were C. albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata, with the highest resistance rates exceeding 30% for C. tropicalis to fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. The main extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were E. coli (86.3%) and K. pneumoniae (11.3%), with resistance rates exceeding 60% for cephalosporins, sulfonamides, quinolones and tetracycline in the single-center.Escherichia coli, E. faecium, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans were the main uropathogens in the southwestern region of China, while E. coli and E. faecium showed the highest antibiotic resistance. The high resistance of ESBL-producing isolates to cephalosporins, sulfonamides, quinolones and tetracycline in the tertiary general hospital suggests a greater challenge to their antibiotic administration and timely ESBL test, and the empirical antimicrobial therapy should greatly consider the updated local characteristics of the uropathogen resistance, and be more cautious in the tertiary general hospital where patients are more likely to harbor higher resistant pathogens.", "venue": "Frontiers in Public Health", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347879900", "name": "Xiaofang Xu"}, {"authorId": "2347872536", "name": "Yuanfang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2348238239", "name": "Ning Li"}, {"authorId": "2347884976", "name": "Yilei Jin"}, {"authorId": "2347912931", "name": "Xinyi Xu"}, {"authorId": "2149135773", "name": "Zhiwei Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2298688459", "name": "Yi Xie"}, {"authorId": "2268732145", "name": "Qun Sun"}]}, {"paperId": "c6ed05d2f4974ba942b2f5c7f74bb43dd97d46c8", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "11868398", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-024-83520-2", "CorpusId": 276672974, "PubMed": "40016314"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6ed05d2f4974ba942b2f5c7f74bb43dd97d46c8", "title": "In silico and in vitro analyses reveal the potential use of Streptomyces parvulus VNUA74 as bioagent for sustainable banana production", "abstract": null, "venue": "Scientific Reports", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348330946", "name": "Trung Thanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2266828523", "name": "Thu Thi Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2260615573", "name": "Thuan Huy Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2348192710", "name": "Loan Thanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2303200200", "name": "Dao Thi Tran"}, {"authorId": "2262430650", "name": "Son Truong Dinh"}, {"authorId": "12406228", "name": "T.

All patients met complete inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the treatment interventions received, they were divided into a control group (n = 63) and an observation group (n = 64). Both groups of patients received routine treatment upon admission. The control group received sulfasalazine in addition to routine interventions, while the observation group received a combination of Saccharomyces boulardii on the basis of the control group\u2019s treatment. The clinical efficacy, improvement in symptoms, modified Baron endoscopic scores, quality of life \u201cinflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ)\u201d, levels of intestinal microbial indicators (such as Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Enterococcus , and Escherichia coli ), intestinal mucosal barrier function indicators [diamine oxidase (DAO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), D-lactic acid (D-LA)], and adverse reaction occurrences were compared between the two groups.\n RESULTS\n (1) Clinical efficacy: The total effective rate in the control group was 79.37%, while in the observation group, it was 93.75%, significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05); (2) Improvement in symptoms: The observation group showed significantly lower relief time for abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fever symptoms, and mucosal healing time compared to the control group (P < 0.05); (3) Baron endoscopic scores and IBDQ scores: Before treatment, there was no significant difference in Baron endoscopic scores and IBDQ scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, after treatment, the observation group showed significantly lower Baron endoscopic scores and higher IBDQ scores compared to the control group (P < 0.05); (4) Levels of intestinal microbial indicators: Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the levels of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Enterococcus , and Escherichia coli between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while the levels of Enterococcus and Escherichia coli were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); (5) Levels of intestinal mucosal barrier function indicators: Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the levels of DAO, LPS, and D-LA between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, after treatment, the levels of DAO, LPS, and D-LA in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); and (6) Occurrence of adverse reactions: The incidence of adverse reactions in the control group was 9.52%, while in the observation group, it was 10.94%. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P > 0.05).\n CONCLUSION\n The application of Saccharomyces boulardii in combination with sulfasalazine in UC patients demonstrates significant effectiveness. Compared to sole sulfasalazine intervention, the combined application of Saccharomyces boulardii further promotes the relief of relevant symptoms in patients, alleviates intestinal mucosal inflammation, and improves the quality of life. Its action may be related to rectifying the imbalance in intestinal microbiota and improving intestinal mucosal barrier function. Moreover, the combined use of Saccharomyces boulardii does not increase the risk of adverse reactions in patients, indicating a higher level of medication safety and advocating for its clinical promotion and application.", "venue": "World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2341697751", "name": "Chun-Chun Yang"}, {"authorId": "2341454033", "name": "Sui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2333627583", "name": "Rui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2312176524", "name": "Ya-nan Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2341459506", "name": "Da-Wei Yang"}, {"authorId": "2333657822", "name": "Mingyue Yang"}, {"authorId": "2341428901", "name": "Li-Jing Huang"}]}, {"paperId": "bdac8d3eb7ac45b316fdb24c035ff3ad522a9117", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "11868249", "DOI": "10.1007/s11046-025-00935-9", "CorpusId": 276646825, "PubMed": "40014183"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdac8d3eb7ac45b316fdb24c035ff3ad522a9117", "title": "Prevalence of the Cladosporium cladosporioides Species Complex in the Mycelia-Like Skin Crusts of Migratory Yellow-Throated Buntings (Emberiza elegans) in Korea", "abstract": null, "venue": "Mycopathologia", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347571919", "name": "Seung-Kyung Lee"}, {"authorId": "2280289059", "name": "Se-Young Park"}, {"authorId": "87874723", "name": "Hwa-yeon Kang"}, {"authorId": "2347538911", "name": "Se-Jeong Han"}, {"authorId": "116963631", "name": "H.

In this study, the strategy of co-inoculating the pectinolytic strain Aureobasidium pullulans GM-R-22 with a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the low-temperature fermentation (LTF, 17.5\u00a0\u00b0C) of Malbec red grapes was evaluated at pilot scale, and compared with a traditional fermentation (TF, 25\u00a0\u00b0C), to compensate for the lower extraction of colour and polyphenols at low maceration temperature. The effects of this strategy on the chromatic, phenolic, technological, antioxidant and sensory properties of Malbec wines were assessed during fermentation and up to 12 months of bottle storage. A. pullulans\u00a0(Ap) grew and remained viable during 4 days of LTF, without affecting the fermentation and growth kinetics of S. cerevisiae (Sc), and significantly higher levels of pectinase activity (about 4.5-fold) were detected in LTF (Ap + Sc) compared to LTF (Sc) and TF (Sc) vinifications. At the end of the fermentation, LTF (Ap + Sc) wine showed higher colour intensity (CI), total anthocyanins (TA), total polyphenolic index (TPI) and a* with a lower L*, b* and filtration time (25\u00a0%) than LTF (Sc) wine. After 12\u00a0months of bottle storage, CI, TPI, TA and monomeric, copigmented and polymeric anthocyanins were significantly higher in LTF (Ap + Sc) than in LTF (Sc) and statistically equal to TF (Sc), although the CIELAB parameters and the antioxidant activity showed no statistical differences compared to control wines. Sensory analysis showed that the LTF (Ap + Sc) wine had greater colour intensity and violet hue than the LTF (Sc) wine, reaching the colour attribute scores of the TF (Sc) wine, and was particularly characterised by a spicy aroma, unlike the wines fermented in the absence of A. pullulans.

However, it deviates from canonical HMGB proteins that have acidic C-terminal domains (CTDs) by bearing a basic one. Hmo1 plays diverse functions in gene regulation and genome integrity. There is evidence implicating Hmo1 in DNA damage tolerance (DDT) that enables DNA replication to bypass lesions on the template. Hmo1 is believed to direct DNA lesions to the error-free template switching (TS) pathway of DDT and aids in the formation of the key TS intermediate sister chromatid junction (SCJ), but the underlying mechanism(s) has yet to be resolved. In this work, we took genetics and molecular biology approaches to further investigate the role of Hmo1 in DDT. We found extensive functional interactions of Hmo1 with components of the genome integrity network in cellular response to the genotoxin methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), implicating Hmo1 in multiple processes in the execution or regulation of homology-directed DNA repair, replication-coupled chromatin assembly, and cell cycle checkpoint. Notably, our data pointed to a role of Hmo1 in directing SJC to the nuclease-mediated resolution pathway instead of the helicase/topoisomerase mediated dissolution pathway for processing/removal. They also suggested that Hmo1 modulates both the recycling of parental histones and the deposition of newly synthesized histones at the replication fork to ensure proper chromatin formation on nascent DNA that is important for DDT. We found evidence that Hmo1 antagonizes the function of histone H2A variant H2A.Z (also known as Htz1 in yeast) in DDT. We also found that Hmo1 is required for DNA damage checkpoint signaling induced by MMS as wells as for DNA negative supercoiling as a proxy of chromatin structure. Moreover, we obtained evidence indicating that the CTD of Hmo1 may or may not be required for its function in DDT depending on the genetic background of the host. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Hmo1 can contribute to, or regulate, multiple processes of DDT via different mechanisms.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347732427", "name": "Jinlong Huo"}, {"authorId": "2347732728", "name": "Anhui Wei"}, {"authorId": "2112461880", "name": "Na Guo"}, {"authorId": "2347858619", "name": "Ruotong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2315551071", "name": "Xin Bi"}]}, {"paperId": "97fdbd37fc5f4ac733cb9675f7da3cec062f618d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/agronomy15030593", "CorpusId": 276717599}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/97fdbd37fc5f4ac733cb9675f7da3cec062f618d", "title": "Potential of Three Plant Extracts in Suppressing Potato Dry Rot Caused by Fusarium incarnatum Under Normal and Cold Storage", "abstract": "The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most widely consumed vegetable crops worldwide. During storage, potato tubers are vulnerable to various phytopathogenic fungi. Dry rot, caused by Fusarium incarnatum, is a common and serious disease that affects potato tubers, leading to partial or complete decay during storage. The current study assessed the effectiveness of three ethanolic extracts including cinnamon bark (CIB), clove buds (CLB), and avocado seeds (AVS) in controlling potato dry rot under both normal and cold storage conditions. In vitro bioassay demonstrated that all tested extracts exhibited a dose-dependent fungistatic effect against F. incarnatum, with inhibition percentages of 83.33% for CIB, 72.22% for CLB, and 67.77% for AVS at the highest tested concentration. Moreover, dipping potato tubers in the tested extracts markedly reduced the severity of dry rot disease under both normal and cold storage conditions. Additionally, treated tubers showed increased activities of defense-related enzymes, including catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Furthermore, there were higher levels of total soluble phenolics and flavonoids, along with an increase in lignin content and a reduction in the weight loss of stored potato tubers compared to the control group. Moreover, the extracts mitigated infection stress and lowered malondialdehyde levels in the treated potato tubers. These extracts show potential as environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical fungicides for managing potato dry rot caused by F. incarnatum under normal and cold storage.", "venue": "Agronomy", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2064071409", "name": "Asmaa El-Nagar"}, {"authorId": "122759994", "name": "Y.

The life cycle of Nosema bombycis is divided into three phases, including the infective phase, the proliferative phase and the sporogonic phase. The factor(s) that regulate spore maturation of Nosema bombycis is still unknown. Ste12 is a fungi-specific transcription factor that plays an important regulatory role in fungal development and pathogenicity. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the function of Ste12 homologous (NbSte12) in Nosema bombycis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we analyzed the transcription and subcellular localization characteristics of NbSte12. It was mainly expressed in the nucleus of the immature spores, and NbSte12 had the transcriptional activation activity, with its C-terminal necessary for this ability. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis revealed that the genes regulated by NbSte12 were involved in spore maturation, cell division, and energy metabolism. The knockdown of NbSte12 gene resulted in the decrease of chitin layer thickness, spore germination activity and proliferation. Then, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses showed that NbSte12 could bind to the promoters of the CHS7, SWP26, SWP30, PTP1 and PTP2 genes, which are involved in spore wall and polar tube formation, thereby positively regulating their transcription.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNbSte12 plays an indispensable role in the formation of chitin layer, spore germination and proliferation, thus regulating the development and maturation of microsporidium Nosema bombycis. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.", "venue": "Pest Management Science", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2165708982", "name": "Hongjie Liao"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Bingqian Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2348185860", "name": "Yuanyu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2216266523", "name": "Liuyi Hong"}, {"authorId": "2109314364", "name": "Yuqing Chen"}, {"authorId": "2216509140", "name": "Zhengkai Xie"}, {"authorId": "2053104474", "name": "Qing Lv"}, {"authorId": "12935771", "name": "Junhong Wei"}, {"authorId": "40519875", "name": "Tian Li"}, {"authorId": "49474524", "name": "G.

To date, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structural studies have provided detailed capsid architectures for 8 of the 35 ssDNA virus families, illustrating variations in assembly mechanisms, symmetry, and structural adaptations of the capsid. However, common features include the conserved jelly-roll motif of the capsid protein and strategies for genome packaging, also showing evolutionary convergence. The ever-increasing availability of genomic sequences of ssDNA viruses and predictive protein modeling programs, such as using AlphaFold, allows for the extension of structural insights to the less-characterized families. Therefore, this review is a comparative analysis of the icosahedral ssDNA virus families and how the capsid proteins are arranged with different tessellations to form icosahedral spheres. It summarizes the current knowledge, emphasizing gaps in the structural characterization of the ssDNA capsidome, and it underscores the importance of continued exploration to understand the molecular underpinnings of capsid function and evolution.

Blood and blood products are analyzed using automated blood culture methods, while pharmacopeial sterility is assessed using membrane filtration or direct inoculation according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1.) to detect microbial growth. As autologous serum eye drops (ASEDs) may be viewed as both a blood product and a classical drug, the Swiss legislator has classified these as non-standardizable drugs, and thus, the pharmacopeial requirements apply. This study investigates ASED preparations with respect to the performance of a common automated blood culture system, BD BACTEC, in detecting aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi in ASED preparations, with pharmacopeial sterility testing using agar plate cultures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBased on the European Pharmacopoeia, we inoculated sterile filtered blood serum with BioBalls of the six reference strains at a low concentration of three colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). A test battery of three different BD BACTEC culture media (hereafter referred to as Trio-BACTEC\u200a:\u200aBD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F-Medium, BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F-Medium, BD BACTEC Mycosis IC/F-Medium) and three agar plates [Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), Chocolate Blood Agar, Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar] were inoculated per strain. We incubated the Trio- BACTEC in the BD BACTEC Blood Culture System at 35\u200a\u00b0C for 5 days, the TSA and Chocolate plates at 35\u200a\u00b0C for 5 days, and the Sabouraud plates at 25\u200a\u00b0C for 7 days. We confirmed positive growth signals by microscopy or MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry and included negative controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe detected all reference strains using BACTEC and agar plates. No growth was observed in the negative controls. Overall, growth detection by BACTEC and agar plates was comparable, except for Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans, which was detected after 1 day on solid media and after 2 days on BACTEC.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study demonstrates the comparability of sensitivity and detection speed using the automated blood culture method and agar plates for sterility validation of ASED, even at low bacterial and fungal contamination levels.", "venue": "Klinische Monatsbl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr Augenheilkunde", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2307134938", "name": "Frank Blaser"}, {"authorId": "2298021828", "name": "Isabelle Meneau"}, {"authorId": "2348701463", "name": "Jana Schneider"}, {"authorId": "2347719300", "name": "J\u00fcrg Wiedler"}, {"authorId": "2347719551", "name": "Hanspeter Hinrikson"}, {"authorId": "2239204610", "name": "Daniel Barthelmes"}, {"authorId": "2252575340", "name": "S.

Several Trichoderma spp. are used in crop health management to promote growth and control plant diseases. Although widely considered beneficial to plants, some members have been reported to be pathogenic to maize, causing a disease called Trichoderma ear rot. Since 2018, Trichoderma afroharzianum has caused significant infections of maize cobs in Germany, France, and Italy. This study aimed to investigate the pathogenicity and phylogenetic relationships among different Trichoderma strains from diverse sources and geographical origins. While previous studies primarily identified T. afroharzianum as the main species causing Trichoderma ear rot, this study found that isolates of T. asperellum, T. atroviride, and T. guizhouense may also exhibit pathogenicity on maize cobs. Additionally, Trichoderma strains from commercial biocontrol products displayed unexpected pathogenicity inducing up to 92% disease severity on maize cobs. Most T. afroharzianum strains induced high levels of disease severity, although some isolates of the same species did not cause any disease, indicating a large heterogeneity in pathogenicity within the species. Notably, phylogeny reconstruction based on the tef1-\u03b1 and rpb2 genes did not result in any discernible clustering between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. A further novel finding is the isolation of pathogenic Trichoderma isolates from agricultural soil, demonstrating that soil can serve as a reservoir for pathogenic species. This study highlights the need for biosecurity assessment and monitoring of Trichoderma strains for agricultural use, considering their beneficial and pathogenic potential.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we explored the ability of different Trichoderma species to infect maize plants. Trichoderma is a group of fungi known for its beneficial role in agriculture, often used as a biological pesticide to control fungal plant diseases. However, some species within this genus can also act as pathogens, causing infections in crops like maize. We found that one species, T. afroharzianum, is particularly aggressive, capable of infecting maize without the plant being wounded first. This makes it a potentially serious threat to crop health. In contrast, other species, such as T. atroviride and T. asperellum, only caused infections when maize plants were injured before. Our research suggests that pathogenic Trichoderma species not only effectively infect plants but can also survive well in soil, making their control difficult. These findings highlight the need for better understanding of how these fungi operate in order to manage the risks they pose to important crops like maize, while still taking advantage of their beneficial uses in agriculture.", "venue": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "146158419", "name": "Annette Pfordt"}, {"authorId": "1398583966", "name": "C.

It investigates the biochemical mechanisms of antioxidant activity, emphasizing compounds such as vitamins (C, E, A), carotenoids, polyphenols, peptides, and minerals, alongside bioactive extracts derived from algae, fungi, lichens, and plants. Carotenoids, including \ua7b5-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and astaxanthin, demonstrate potent antioxidant activity, making them crucial for photoprotection and anti-aging. Phenolic compounds, such as ferulic acid, resveratrol, hesperidin, and xanthohumol, play a significant role in neutralizing oxidative stress and improving skin health. This review also highlights bioactives from algae, fungi, and lichens. Algae, particularly microalgae like Haematococcus pluvialis, known for astaxanthin production, are highlighted for their extraordinary photoprotective and anti-aging properties. Brown algae (Fucus vesiculosus) and red algae (Porphyra) provide polysaccharides and bioactive molecules that enhance hydration and barrier function. Fungi contribute a wealth of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, including polysaccharides, \ua7b5-glucans, and enzymes, which support cellular repair and protect against oxidative damage. Lichens, through unique phenolic metabolites, offer potent free-radical-scavenging properties and serve as effective ingredients in formulations targeting environmental stress. Plant-derived antioxidants offer a diverse range of benefits. Plant-derived antioxidants, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and carotenoids, further amplify skin resilience, hydration, and repair mechanisms, aligning with the growing demand for nature-inspired solutions in cosmetics. The integration of these diverse natural sources into cosmetic formulations reflects the industry\u2019s commitment to sustainability, innovation, and efficacy. By harnessing the synergistic potential of bioactives from algae, fungi, lichens, and plants, modern cosmetology is advancing toward multifunctional, health-conscious, and eco-friendly products. Future research directions include optimizing delivery systems for these bioactives, enhancing their stability and bioavailability, and expanding their applications to meet evolving dermatological challenges.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "3789424", "name": "A.

Two lipopeptides, C14-NleRR-NH2 (Nel) and C14-WRR-NH2 (WR), were evaluated against six fluconazole-resistant C. auris isolates. Both molecules showed good antimicrobial activity as demonstrated by MIC determination, time-kill, and microscopy experiments. The peptides were able to inhibit fungal growth, while sub-MIC concentrations of the molecules delayed the growth. Moreover, the combinations of the two peptides with fluconazole demonstrated a reciprocal potentiation by checkerboard and time-kill experiments. Our results showed that antimicrobial peptides could be a promising option for the treatment of antifungal-resistant C. auris.IMPORTANCEAs well as antibiotics, also in fungal infections, antimicrobial resistance increased over the years. Moreover, in the last years, a new species emerged, Candida auris, as a nosocomial pathogen. C. auris possesses intrinsic resistance to common antifungals, such as azoles, that complicate therapeutic options.

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 500 consecutive cases of culture-proven infectious keratitis diagnosed and treated by corneal specialists at Yamaguchi University Hospital between 2009 and 2021. Seasonal distribution patterns were analyzed for each pathogen category and specific microorganisms. Results: Among the 500 cases, bacteria were identified in 249 eyes (49.8%), viruses in 173 eyes (34.6%), fungi in 51 eyes (10.2%), and Acanthamoeba in 27 eyes (5.4%). The top 10 causative microorganisms constituted 80.4% of all cases. Distinct seasonal patterns emerged: bacterial keratitis peaked during winter months (October\u2013March), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections clustered in late summer (August\u2013September), Acanthamoeba keratitis showed summer predominance (June\u2013August), and HSV keratitis was most frequent in winter to spring (January\u2013May). Overall incidence peaked from January to March and reached its nadir in June. Conclusions: This long-term study revealed distinct seasonal patterns for specific pathogens causing infectious keratitis in Japan. The findings suggest that geographical location and climate may influence the temporal distribution of corneal infections.

The practical application of dimethomorph (DIM) is hindered by its hydrophobic nature, posing risks to nontarget organisms. Inspired by the uptake of nanomaterials by plants, DIM was encapsulated in the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity to optimize its water-solubility and the sustained-release rate. The spatial confinement effect of CD could facilitate the thermostability of DIM. DIM/CD inclusion complex solutions were electrospun to fabricate nanofibers with bead-free and smooth morphology. As predicted, the release of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers reached plateaus with accumulative release values of approximately 75%. The antifungal activity of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers possesses much higher than DIM for controlling Rhizoctonia solani and Haematonectria hematococco, thereby enhancing its antifungal bioactivity and reducing pesticide spraying frequency. The inhibition rates of Rhizoctonia solani by DIM/HP\u03b2CD and DIM/HP\u03b3CD inclusion complex nanofibers are found to be 55.8% and 53.6% within 144 h, respectively.

However, Delftia sp. supporting wheat plants is yet to be explored. Methods Delftia strain was cultured from wheat rhizosphere using different growth conditions. The biofertilizer potential of Delftia strain was assessed through physiological, biochemical, genomic, and field experiments. Results and Discussion Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analysis confirmed taxonomic affiliation with Delftia lacustris. In vitro phosphate solubilization (0.325IU), nitrate reduction (0.401 IU), IAA production (0.485 IU), ACC deaminase activity (0.512 EU), siderophore synthesis properties, and strong antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani indicated its potential as an effective biofertilizer and biocontrol agent. Drought stress tolerance (up to 40% PEG), metal stress tolerance, salt stress tolerance (up to 11.69% NaCl (w/v), 11.18% KCl (w/v), 4.24% LiCl (w/v)) indicated its survivability even in hostile conditions. Genes for phosphate solubilization (PhoR, PhoB, PhoU, PstABCD), nitrogen fixation (nifC, nifU), auxin production, siderophore biosynthesis, rhizosphere colonization and antifungal properties (chitinase, PhnZ) explains Delftia lacustris bioactivities. Significantly enhanced seed germination (93.33% \u00b1 0.23), seedling growth, and biomass (P <0.05), particularly under stress conditions, indicated plant growth promotion properties of the Delftia strain. Significantly improved plant growth and yield parameters (P=0.0001) in field experiments, highlighting its potential as a biofertilizer and biocontrol agent.

This study investigates the genomic adaptations associated with the evolution of the ambrosia lifestyle across multiple fungal lineages. We performed comparative genomic analyses on 70 fungal genomes from four families (Irpicaceae, Ceratocystidaceae, Nectriaceae, and Ophiostomataceae), including 24 ambrosia and 34 non-ambrosia lineages. Our phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple independent colonization of insect vectors by the fungi, spanning from the mid-Cretaceous (114.6 Ma) to the early Quaternary (1.9 Ma). Contrary to expectations for obligate symbionts, ambrosia fungi showed no significant genome-wide modification in size, gene count, or secreted protein repertoire compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Instead, we observed conservation of most assessed genomic features; where genome traits differ between free-living relatives and ambrosia fungi, the changes are lineage-specific, not convergent. Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations.

Using bioinformatics and metabolomics, we characterize microbial diversity and metabolic variations to understand flavor development. A total of 1490 bacterial and 1158 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. Young fruits had higher microbial diversity, dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (bacteria) and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (fungi). As the fruit matured, Proteobacteria increased while Firmicutes decreased, indicating that microbial succession is tied to development. Metabolomic profiling identified 87 volatile and 1002 non-volatile metabolites, with distinct chemical classes varying across stages. Saturated hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols were the main volatile metabolites, while organic acids and lipids among non-volatile metabolites showed stage-dependent changes, influencing flavor complexity. Correlation analysis showed microbial-flavor interactions: Proteobacteria negatively correlated with metabolites, while Firmicutes positively correlated with metabolites. Ascomycota positively correlated with volatile metabolites, whereas Basidiomycota showed an inverse relationship, highlighting their differential contributions to flavor biosynthesis. This study enhances understanding of microbial and metabolic factors shaping P. ligularis fruit flavor, highlighting the importance of microbial influence on fruit metabolomics.

Microbial diversity in wineries depends on several factors, such as the grape variety and its ripeness, temperature, relative humidity and the diverse activities of the winemaking process. Winery surfaces and equipment allow the establishment of a microbial community that can impact wine quality, the health of winery workers and visitors and even wine consumers. In the context of climate change, changes in the sugar content, phenolic compounds and the profile of hexoses and amino acids are already evident. These changes interfere with the fermentation microbiota and the quality of the wines, which are more alcoholic and less acidic. Furthermore, periods of drought or heavy rain favor species associated with berry diseases, including some capable of producing mycotoxins or harmful biogenic amines.

Changes in microbial community composition were assessed using 16S-targeted Illumina sequencing. Overall, test product supplementation resulted in increased saccharolytic fermentation, as evidenced by increases in the health-promoting bacterial metabolites as propionate (donor-dependent), acetate and butyrate (donor-dependent) as well as increased abundances of several saccharolytic fermenting microbes, including Bifidobacterium.

A total of 17 female dogs and their 81 puppies were included. From day 28 of gestation until the end of the study, bitches were divided into two groups, one of which received orally 1.3 \u00d7 109 colony forming units of live yeast per day. Puppies from mothers receiving the live yeast were defined as the SB group (n = 40) and the others were defined as the placebo group (n = 4 1). For each puppy, EGR was calculated, and blood and urine samples were collected at D2 for metabolome analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Puppies from the SB group presented higher EGR compared with the placebo group (12% vs. 7%; p = 0.049). According to the Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA), both urine and serum metabolome profiles were significantly different between the two groups with a total of 29 discriminating metabolites in urine and serum.

But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging <1% across protein-coding regions in most animals, plants, and fungi. There are even instances in which divergence between sister species is the same or less than that among conspecifics. In contrast, bacterial species, defined as populations exchanging homologous genes, show levels of divergence both within and between species that are considerably higher. Although no single threshold delineates species, eukaryotic populations with >1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2159598075", "name": "Rowan Hart"}, {"authorId": "2239834532", "name": "N.

Current methodologies often prioritize specific target families, neglecting the complexity and presence of co-occurring compounds. This work addresses a fundamental question: Can we assess molecular similarity and predict the toxicity of mycotoxins in silico using a defined set of molecular descriptors? We propose a rapid nontarget screening approach for multiple classes of mycotoxins, integrating both unsupervised and supervised machine learning models, alongside molecular and physicochemical descriptors to enhance the understanding of structural similarity, activity, and toxicity. Clustering analyses identify natural clusters corresponding to the known mycotoxin families, indicating that mycotoxins belonging to the same cluster share similar molecular properties. However, topological descriptors play a significant role in distinguishing between acutely toxic and nonacutely toxic compounds. Random forest (RF) and neural networks (NN), combined with molecular descriptors, contribute to improved knowledge and predictive capability regarding mycotoxin toxicity profiles. RF allows the prediction of toxicity using data reflecting mainly structural features and performs well in the presence of descriptors reflecting biological activity. NN models prove to be more sensitive to biological activity descriptors than RF. The use of descriptors encompassing structural complexity and diversity, chirality and symmetry, connectivity, atomic charge, and polarizability, together with descriptors representing lipophilicity, absorption, and permeation of molecules, is crucial for predicting toxicity, facilitating broader toxicological evaluations.", "venue": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2507913", "name": "T\u00e2nia F Cova"}, {"authorId": "2347573513", "name": "Cl\u00e1udia Ferreira"}, {"authorId": "145810191", "name": "S.

In this study, we developed a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-based selection system as an innovative alternative to traditional auxotrophic selection strategies for engineering S. boulardii. The DHFR selection system overcame inherent resistance of the yeast to methotrexate (MTX) by incorporating sulfanilamide, a dihydrofolate synthesis inhibitor, to enhance selection efficiency. The system demonstrated robust functionality, enabling the efficient screening of high-expression clones and tunable expression of therapeutic proteins, such as cytokines and antibodies, by modulating MTX concentrations. Furthermore, the yeast\u2019s endogenous DHFR homolog, DFR1, was shown to be a viable selection marker, providing greater host compatibility while maintaining functionality compared to DHFR. This selection system avoids reliance on foreign antibiotic selection markers and the construction of auxotrophic strains, thus simplifying engineering and allowing for a tunable protein expression.

As one of the most commercially used rootstocks in citrus, Poncirus trifoliata heavily depends on AM fungi for nutrient absorption. The GRAS gene family plays essential roles in plant growth and development, signaling transduction, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the identification and functional characterization of GRAS family genes in P. trifoliata remains largely unexplored. In this study, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of PtGRAS family genes was conducted, including their identification, physicochemical properties, phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, conserved domains, chromosome localization, and collinear relationships. Additionally, the expression profiles and protein interaction of these genes under AM symbiosis were systematically investigated. As a result, 41 GRAS genes were identified in the P. trifoliata genome, and classified into nine distinct clades. Collinearity analysis revealed seven segmental duplications but no tandem duplications, suggesting that segmental duplication played a more important role in the expansion of the PtGRAS gene family compared to tandem duplication. Additionally, 18 PtGRAS genes were differentially expressed in response to AM symbiosis, including orthologs of RAD1, RAM1, and DELLA3 in P. trifoliata. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening further revealed that PtGRAS6 and PtGRAS20 interacted with both PtGRAS12 and PtGRAS18, respectively. The interactions were subsequently validated through bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. These findings underscored the crucial role of GRAS genes in AM symbiosis in P. trifoliata, and provided valuable candidate genes for improving nutrient uptake and stress resistance in citrus rootstocks through molecular breeding approaches.", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "2330271350", "name": "Fang Song"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Chuanya Ji"}, {"authorId": "2347771314", "name": "Tingting Wang"}, {"authorId": "2348183885", "name": "Zelu Zhang"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Yaoyuan Duan"}, {"authorId": "2268164881", "name": "Miao Yu"}, {"authorId": "2330392051", "name": "Xin Song"}, {"authorId": "48752022", "name": "Yingchun Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2112531278", "name": "Ligang He"}, {"authorId": "1483797665", "name": "Zhijing Wang"}, {"authorId": "2107250650", "name": "Xiaofang Ma"}, {"authorId": "2330496155", "name": "Yu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2348313288", "name": "Zhiyong Pan"}, {"authorId": "2108636137", "name": "Liming Wu"}]}, {"paperId": "2571b2a06b37625c7e7b44f4fbc88fd410b7a1c0", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00687", "CorpusId": 276670723, "PubMed": "40015976"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2571b2a06b37625c7e7b44f4fbc88fd410b7a1c0", "title": "Integrated Study of Fluorescence Enhancement in the Y176H Variant of Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1.", "abstract": "Phytochromes are red-light-sensitive biliprotein photoreceptors that control a variety of physiological processes in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Lately, greater attention has been paid to these photoreceptors due to their potential as fluorescent probes for deep-tissue microscopy. Such fluorescing phytochromes have been generated by multiple amino acid substitutions in weakly fluorescent wild-type (WT) proteins. Remarkably, the single substitution of conserved Tyr176 by His in cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 increases the fluorescence quantum yield from 2.4 to 14.5%. In this work, we studied this Y176H variant by crystallography, MAS NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy complemented by theoretical methods. Two factors were identified to account for the strong fluorescence increase. First, the equilibrium between the photoactive and fluorescent substates of WT Cph1 was shown to shift entirely to the fluorescent substate in Y176H. Second, structural flexibility of the chromophore is drastically reduced and the photoisomerization barrier is raised, thereby increasing the excited-state lifetime. The most striking finding, however, is that Y176H includes the structural properties of both the dark-adapted Pr and the light-activated Pfr state. While the chromophore adopts the Pr-typical ZZZssa configuration, the tongue segment of the protein adopts a Pfr-typical \u03b1-helical structure. This implies that Tyr176 plays a key role in coupling chromophore photoisomerization to the sheet-to-helix transition of the tongue and the final Pfr structure. This conclusion extends to plant phytochromes, where the homologous substitution causes light-independent signaling activity akin to that of Pfr.", "venue": "Biochemistry", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "38989527", "name": "S.

Traditional thermal processing methods, such as cooking and pasteurization, are effective at killing pathogens, but they can also damage food quality. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) can inactivate foodborne pathogens without damaging food quality. CAP has several advantages over traditional thermal processing methods. It is a non-thermal process, meaning that it does not heat food. This can help to preserve the nutritional and sensory quality of food. CAP can be targeted to specific areas of food, such as the surface or interior. This can help to reduce the overall processing time and energy consumption. In the study, two Gram (+) (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644), three Gram (-) (Salmonella typhimurium CCM 5445, Salmonella enteridis ATCC 13076, Escherichia coli O157:H7), and one yeast culture (Candida albicans ATCC 10231), known as pathogens, were used to examine the influence of CAP on microorganisms. The samples were treated with CAP at different power rates (100, 150, and 200\u2009W) and exposure times (30, 60, 180, and 300\u2009s) with different application parameters (directly to microorganisms, distilled water, microorganism + distilled water combination). Then, the number of viable cells was determined after the procedure. Among the methods, it was found that the direct cold plasma application is the most effective for the inhibition of microorganisms. Besides, it was designated that the inhibition of pathogen microorganisms increased as the power rate and contact time enhanced. Cold plasma treatment induced membrane damage in microorganism cells, with the severity of damage increased with longer treatment times.

Enzymatic synthesis, featuring mild conditions, environmental friendliness, and high selectivity, has gained attention from academia and industry. Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) is widely utilized due to its high efficiency in catalyzing the esterification of phytosterol. Natural lipases are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and pH and are difficult to reuse in continuous cycles; however, certain immobilization techniques can improve their catalytic activity and stability. Furthermore, the application of immobilized lipases in the synthesis of phytosterol esters can be combined with ultrasonic treatment to enhance the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis.

The morphology (size and shape) of mitochondrial compartments is highly responsive to both intracellular and extracellular conditions, making these organelles highly dynamic. Nutrient levels and stressors both inside and outside the cell inform the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion and the recycling of mitochondrial components known as mitophagy. The study of mitochondrial morphology and its implications in human disease and microbial engineering have gained significant attention over the past decade. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a valuable model system for studying mitochondria due to its ability to survive without respiring, its genetic tractability, and the high degree of mitochondrial similarity across eukaryotic species. Here, we review how the interplay between mitochondrial fission, fusion, biogenesis, and mitophagy regulates the dynamic nature of mitochondrial networks in both yeast and mammalian systems with an emphasis on yeast as a model organism. Additionally, we examine the crucial role of inter-organelle interactions, particularly between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The dysregulation of any of these processes gives rise to abnormal mitochondrial morphologies, which serve as the distinguishing features of numerous diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer. Notably, yeast models have contributed to revealing the underlying mechanisms driving these human disease states. In addition to furthering our understanding of pathologic processes, aberrant yeast mitochondrial morphologies are of increasing interest to the seemingly distant field of metabolic engineering, following the discovery that compartmentalization of certain biosynthetic pathways within mitochondria can significantly improve chemical production. In this review, we examine the utility of yeast as a model organism to study mitochondrial morphology in both healthy and pathologic states, explore the nascent field of mitochondrial morphology engineering, and discuss the methods available for the quantification and classification of these key mitochondrial morphologies.", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-27", "authors": [{"authorId": "1705199789", "name": "Therese C Kichuk"}, {"authorId": "2348024647", "name": "Jos\u00e9 L.

EECs, which constitute less than 1% of intestinal epithelial cells, are key regulators of gut\u2013brain communication, energy metabolism, gut motility, and satiety. Recent evidence shows that gut microbiota directly influence EEC function, maturation, and hormone secretion. For instance, commensal bacteria regulate the production of hormones like glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY by modulating gene expression and vesicle cycling in EE cells. Additionally, metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, derived from microbial fermentation, play a central role in regulating EEC signaling pathways that affect metabolism, gut motility, and immune responses. Furthermore, the interplay between gut microbiota, EECs, and metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, is examined, emphasizing the microbiome's dual role in promoting health and contributing to disease states.

Nevertheless, the association between microorganisms and douchi flavor is still poorly understood. In this study, high-throughput sequencing, amino acid analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to investigate the bacterial and fungal profiles as well as the flavor compounds (sixteen amino acids and one-hundred volatile flavor compounds) of seven different types of douchi. High levels of glutamic and aspartic acids were observed. Microbial analysis found that Bacillus, Tetragenococcus, Weissella, Aspergillus, Mucor, and Penicillium were the prime microorganisms. In total, 100 volatile components were detected; however, none of them was common to all the douchi products, although most volatile components had the aromas of flowers, fruits, caramel, and cocoa. An analysis of the flavor compounds was conducted using two-way orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O2PLS-DA). Based on the analysis, it was found that Glu had negative correlations with most microorganisms, and Aspergillus had positive correlations with 2-pentylfuran and phenylacetaldehyde.

Several species of fungi in the genus Candida are reported to cause mucosal and systemic infections with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Infections caused by Candida are called candidiasis, one type of which is Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (Vulvovaginal Candidiasis). In the last few decades, Lactobacillus probiotics have become an alternative strategy for treating various types of infections, including L. plantarum. The comparison of effectiveness between oral and intravaginal administration of L. plantarum still needs to be studied, considering that this really determines the success rate of probiotics as supportive therapy in cases of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Objective: To compare body weight gain after oral and intravaginal administration of L. plantarum in vivo. Method: The research was conducted using a pretest posttest randomized experimental group design approach. The L. plantarum given consisted of three concentrations, namely 2,25x1010, 4,5x1010 and 9x1010 CFU/ml. The statistical analysis used was a paired T-test (CI 95%) to measure body weight before and after administration of L. plantarum. Results: There was a significant increase in the body weight of the study sample with oral and intravaginal administration. Conclusion: Probiotic L. plantarum given orally and intravaginally has the potential to be a supportive therapy for vulvovaginal candidiasis infections. \n\u00a0", "venue": "Jurnal Penelitian Keperawatan Kontemporer", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-26", "authors": [{"authorId": "2259000386", "name": "Nur Sophia Matin"}, {"authorId": "2231506155", "name": "Regina Ayu Fristiyanti"}]}, {"paperId": "f6b239289358a896750c696023aab92fe81478b0", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.18203/2320-1770.ijrcog20250521", "CorpusId": 276689066}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6b239289358a896750c696023aab92fe81478b0", "title": "Treatment for asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis to reduce preterm birth: a systematic review", "abstract": "Vaginal candidiasis, a prevalent fungal infection in women caused by the overgrowth of Candida species, primarily Candida albicans, often triggers a hyperimmune response. While it is rarely life-threatening, it can be uncomfortable, posing risks to both pregnant mothers and their unborn children, thus affecting quality of life. This systematic review aimed to determine whether treating asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis during pregnancy reduces the incidence of preterm birth. Literature search was conducted across four electronic databases finds randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the treatment of vaginal candidiasis (clotrimazole) with usual care (no-treatment). The search was updated in August 2024, with no language restrictions. Participants were pregnant women between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome measured was the rate of preterm birth, while secondary outcomes included adverse pregnancy events such as premature rupture of membranes, perinatal death, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Data analysis utilized review manager (RevMan) software. Three RCTs involving 3,868 pregnant women were included, with 1,942 in the clotrimazole group and 1,926 in the usual care group. The primary outcome revealed spontaneous preterm birth rates of 2% in the treatment group compared to 6.3% in the usual care group. Meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant effect favouring treatment, with a pooled effect size of -0.05 (95% CI -0.09, -0.01). Treating asymptomatic candidiasis in early pregnancy appears to reduce preterm birth risk. However, results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited number of studies.

However, the mechanisms by which soil microbes influence nutrient cycling under different crop types remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the network structure, diversity, and microbial composition of croplands in the Yellow River Delta, focusing on four primary crops: soybean, maize, cotton, and sorghum. The findings revealed that the co-occurring network structure of sorghum planting-soils exhibited greater complexity than other crop types. Bacterial alpha diversity in cotton-planting soil is the highest and susceptible to environmental variations. The diversity of both rare and abundant taxa responds differently to soil nutrients depending on the crop type. While abundant taxa play a crucial role in soil multi-nutrient cycling, rare taxa are key drivers of variations in nutrient cycling expression. The diversity of rare taxa showed a strong correlation with critical nutrients. Structural equation modeling revealed that the alpha diversity of rare bacterial and fungal taxa significantly influenced the soil multi-nutrient cycling index (MNC). Specifically, higher Shannon indices of rare bacterial taxa were associated with lower MNC, while the opposite was true for soil fungi. Soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen are the key factors influencing alpha diversity in rare bacterial and fungal taxa.

In this study, we used metagenomic technology to study the microbial structure of bioflocs (BF) produced from furfural residue wastewater. The microbial structure is one of the most important parts of BF applications and must be distinguished from activated sludge. Metagenomic analysis is suitable to show us the essence of BF.

The heatmap shows a significant difference in BF and CK. The relative abundance of ARGs (Antibiotics resistance genes) in BF is also lower than CK, decreasing by 62.13%.

These chemicals are potential functional food ingredients owing to their attractive biological activities. However, natural prenylated flavonoids are rare, which limits their application.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we reported the prenylation of apigenin and genistein catalyzed by DMATS1, a dimethylallyl-l-tryptophan synthase from Fusarium fujikuroi. High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance identified their structure as 6-C-prenylapigenin (6-PA) and 6-C-prenylgenistein (6-PG), respectively.

Medicago sativa L. (lucerne) is one of the major legume crops in global forage industry. This study aimed to identify bacteria capable of biologically controlling the wilt pathogen through a comprehensive screening of bacterial isolates obtained from domesticated and wild growing Medicago seeds. Using a multi-tiered evaluation pipeline, including in vitro, soil-free and potting mix-based pathogenicity and bioprotection assay systems, the bioprotection efficacy of 34 bacterial isolates derived from Medicago seeds was initially evaluated against six Fusarium strains in vitro. Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) F5189, which has previously been characterized as a Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis isolate causing Fusarium wilt in lucerne was selected for in planta assays. Lucerne cultivars Grazer and Sequel, representing susceptible and resistant genotypes were chosen to assess the disease progression. Pathogenicity and bioprotection time-course studies were conducted to understand the temporal dynamics of host-pathogen interactions and efficacy of the bioprotectants. The disease symptoms were scored using a disease rating index developed in this study. The results indicated variability in bioprotection efficacy across bacterial isolates, with some strains suppressing disease in both soil-free and potting mix-based systems. Paenibacillus sp. (Lu_MgY_007; NCBI: PQ756884) and Pseudomonas sp. (Lu_LA164_018; NCBI: PQ756887) were identified as promising bioprotectants against Fusarium wilt under tested growth conditions. The time-course studies highlighted the critical role of persistent biocontrol activity and precise timing of biocontrol application for achieving long-term disease suppression. Overall, the observed reduction in disease severity underscores the potential of these bioprotectants as sustainable strategies for managing Fusarium wilt in lucerne cultivars.

Main evidence indicating its fungal nature was the taphonomic scenario inferred and the detection of preserved chitin polysaccharides in the filamentous structures, using specific chitin markers visualized under confocal laser microscopy. Herein is present a similar fungal colonization pattern forming thin cortices observed in extant kauri pine resin (Agathis australis: Araucariaceae) from New Zealand.

Trichoderma has been increasingly popular among forward-thinking farmers as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in recent years. Its slow rate of colonization and reproduction, vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses, inability to totally remove pathogens, and high cost are the primary causes of its low adoption among farmers. To get over these obstacles, distinct strains of Trichoderma that are quick to grow and colonize, least impacted by environmental factors, and have a broad host range of diseases should be found. To ensure its widespread use, farmers should also be educated about the value of Trichoderma in agriculture through a variety of extension services. Trichoderma, which functions as a biofertilizer, bioremediation, and biocontrol agent, may be a practical and sustainable substitute.However, Trichoderma's applicability at the farmer level is still lacking, and its utilization is restricted to research endeavors.

Through BLASTx analysis of the NCBI non-redundant database, 27 mycovirus-related contigs were identified, which corresponded to 10 distinct viruses grouped into 8 lineages: Alternaviridae, Chrysoviridae, Partitiviridae, Polymycoviridae, Orthototiviridae, Deltaflexiviridae, Narnaviridae, and Bunyaviricetes. Full genomic sequences of these viruses were characterized and confirmed to be associated with their host fungi. The findings included six novel mycoviruses, three previously unreported viruses discovered in new hosts, and one virus strain.

Drug combinations are a potential therapeutic approach to overcome the drug- resistance of C. albicans. This study explored the synergistic effects of amantadine hydrochloride (AMH) combined with azole antifungal drugs against drug-resistant C. albicans in vitro and in vivo.The in vitro sensitivity of Candida spp. to drugs was determined by the microdilution method. The effect of drugs on the efflux pump activity of C.\u00a0albicans was determined by the rhodamine 6G tracer method. The egg yolk agar plate method was used to determine the activity of extracellular phospholipase, a C. albicans virulence factor. The Galleria mellonella model\u00a0of\u00a0C. albicans infection was used to test the in vivo efficacy of the combination therapy.In vitro experiments showed that combinations of AMH with azole antifungal drugs had synergistic antifungal effects on planktonic cells of drug-resistant C. albicans, with fractional inhibitory concentration index values of <0.5. The in vivo synergistic effects and mechanism of drug combinations with AMH were further studied using fluconazole (FLC) as a representative azole antifungal drug. In vivo, G. mellonella larvae were used to evaluate the antifungal efficacy of AMH +FLC. AMH + FLC treatment increased the survival rate of larvae infected with drug-resistant C. albicans and reduced tissue invasion. Studies of the mechanism of synergy showed that AMH inhibited drug efflux pump activity in drug-resistant C. albicans, and that AMH + FLC synergistically inhibited early biofilms and the extracellular phospholipase activity of drug-resistant C. albicans.This study provides strong evidence that combinations of non-antifungal drugs and antifungal drugs can effectively overcome drug-resistant C.\u00a0albicans infection.

Yet, the composition and dynamics of endophytic fungi in Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (Franch.) Hara (PPC) during fresh seed (FD), sand-stored seed (SSD), and seedling (SS) stages remain unclear. Similarly, the overall impact of phytohormones on the management of endophytic fungal communities is yet to be elucidated.We carried out a pot experiment to examine the effects of various stages of PPC seeds and the external addition of three phytohormones, namely, melatonin (MT), strigolactone (SL), and 24-epibrassinolide (BR) on the endophytic fungi of PPC seedlings. This was done through internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon sequencing.The study of the endophytic fungal microbiome in FD, SSD, and SS stages of PPC revealed an increased richness and diversity of fungi during the SS stage, with significant changes in community composition observed. We found that Sordariomycetes played a crucial role in this process, potentially contributing to the establishment and growth of PPC seedlings. Additionally, this study investigated the influence of phytohormones on the phenotypic and physiological characteristics of PPC and its endophytic fungal community. Our results demonstrated that MT and SL significantly increased PPC biomass by 69.32 and 15.23%, respectively, while 2 mg/L of BR hindered the growth of PPC roots. MT, SL, and BR not only induced significant changes in the composition and diversity of the endophytic fungal community in PPC but also affected biomass potentially through specific regulation of potential biomarkers. Furthermore, phytohormones were shown to indirectly modify the endophytic fungal community by altering antioxidant system in plants.This study provides novel insights into the dynamic changes of microbial communities in the FD, SSD, and SS stages.

Despite the critical role of microorganisms, particularly bacteria and fungi, the microbial consortia in M. crassifolia\u2019s rhizosphere remain underexplored. Methods: Metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) was employed to elucidate the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the soil rhizosphere of M. crassifolia. Results: The data revealed a marked predominance of bacterial genomes relative to fungal communities, as evidenced by non-redundant gene analysis. Notably, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), specifically Rhizophagus clarus, Rhizophagus irregularis and Funneliformis geosporum, are key rhizosphere colonizers. This study confirmed the presence of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), such as Sphingomonas spp., Cyanobacteria and Pseudomonadota, underscoring the critical role of these microorganisms in the phosphorus cycle. Additionally, the study uncovered the presence of previously uncharacterized species within the phylum Actinobacteria, as well as unidentified taxa from the Betaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadota and Chloroflexota phyla, which may represent novel microbial taxa with potential plant growth-promoting properties. Conclusions: Findings suggest a complex, symbiotic network where AMF facilitate phosphorus uptake through plant\u2013root interactions. In a tripartite symbiosis, PSB enhance inorganic phosphorus solubilization, increasing bioavailability, which AMF assimilate and deliver to plant roots, optimizing nutrition.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of double and triple antibiotic combinations against common oral pathogens, and to incorporate the most effective combination into a thermosensitive hydrogel, to develop an alternative intracanal medication. Antibiotics were tested alone and in combination in planktonic and biofilm conditions of oral bacteria and Candida albicans. The antibiotic combinations with potential antimicrobial synergy were tested on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms in radicular dentin by confocal microscopy. Metronidazole (ME), ciprofloxacin (CI), and fosfomycin (FO) were incorporated into poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) hydrogels, and their antibiofilm activity was compared to PNVCL hydrogels containing chlorhexidine (CHX) or calcium hydroxide (CH). The cytotoxicity of the hydrogels was assessed on MDPC-23 odontoblast-like cells using metiltetrazolium assays. A statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s test (p < 0.05). The combination of ME + CI + FO showed superior antibiofilm effects in mono- and dual-species biofilms and on biofilms inside dentinal tubules, comparable to CHX. PNVCL hydrogels with ME + CI + FO significantly reduced E. faecalis biofilms in dentinal tubules, exhibiting a higher efficacy than PNVCL + CH. Cytotoxicity tests revealed minimal effects on cell viability for both PNVCL hydrogels with and without antibiotics. In conclusion, ME + CI + FO showed potent antimicrobial synergy and, when loaded in thermosensitive PNVCL hydrogel, demonstrated significant antibiofilm activity and low cytotoxicity. These findings emphasize the potential of this formulation as an effective and biocompatible endodontic medication, especially for the treatment of immature permanent teeth.", "venue": "Processes", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-26", "authors": [{"authorId": "2146155649", "name": "Cristiane Duque"}, {"authorId": "2197234627", "name": "Gabriela Pacheco de Almeida Braga"}, {"authorId": "2347649437", "name": "Juliana Machado de Carvalho"}, {"authorId": "12959146", "name": "K.

This study, part of the H2020 BRESOV project, assessed the effects of three nutritional protocols (NPs) on eight broccoli genotypes (GEs), comprising two commercial F1 hybrids and six Sicilian landraces. The tested NPs included formulations containing Trichoderma species, organic nitrogen, and essential micronutrients such as iron, zinc, carbon, boron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. This trial was conducted on an organic farm in Adrano (CT). Plants were evaluated for key traits related to growth, development, and seed production. NUE was analyzed to measure the efficiency of nitrogen conversion from soil into seed production. Significant interactions between NPs and GEs were observed for all seed yield components and most morphometric traits, except for secondary branches and root width, varying significantly only among the tested genotypes. The Sicilian landraces Broccolo nero and Sparaceddi showed the highest seed yield, overcoming the productive performances of the commercial hybrids F1 Marathon and Gentleman. Broccolo nero, grown using amino acid microbial consortia applied solely via fertigation (NP1), exhibited the highest NUE, indicating a positive nitrogen balance relative to seed yield and soil nitrogen content. Principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the genotypes into five distinct clusters based on the analyzed bio-morphometric traits and on the effect of the treatment. The Broccolo nero and Sparaceddi genotypes formed two distinct groups, clearly differentiated by their unique morphological traits related to plant biomass and seed production. Additionally, both genotypes exhibited distinct responses to the applied nutrition protocols, with positive results compared to the control condition. These results underscore the potential of the broccoli landraces for organic farming and breeding due to their adaptability, resilience, and superior NUE.", "venue": "Horticulturae", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-26", "authors": [{"authorId": "2282001703", "name": "Gresheen Garcia"}, {"authorId": "2244466075", "name": "Simone Treccarichi"}, {"authorId": "2282054150", "name": "Riccardo Cal\u00ec"}, {"authorId": "2128748823", "name": "D.

However, it can be linked with systemic adverse effects and drug\u2013drug interactions, especially in immunocompromised and poly-medicated patients. Topical antifungals, associated with a low risk of systemic adverse effects and drug\u2013drug interactions, have emerged as the most suitable treatment option for patients with diabetic foot disease. However, the duration of topical treatment can extend up to 12 months. Consequently, there is a need to bolster these topical treatments with complementary therapies. Methods: The current study acquired approval from an ethics committee (code 24/241-E) and Clinical Trials (code NCT06485050). No patients were excluded, irrespective of comorbidities or the severity of onychomycosis. Patients included in the study were administered Ciclopirox 8% (consisting of ethyl acetate, 96% ethanol, ketostearyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl chitosan, and purified water) once daily for 6 months. This was supplemented with photodynamic therapy (three sessions in the first 2 months) using toluidine blue gel and a 635 nm diode laser lasting 10 min, as well as monthly debridement of the nail plate. Results: All patients (10/10) included in the study exhibited negative microbiological culture results 6 months after the study began. Of these, 90% (9/10) were clinically cured, and thus, fully cured. No adverse effects or complications secondary to the treatments were observed in any of the cases. The average Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI) value was initially 18.50 \u00b1 8.947, reduced to 10.30 \u00b1 6.129 at 3 months, and finally fell to 4.10 \u00b1 4.08 at the end of the treatment.

Recently, biosynthetic research has benefited significantly from progress on various fronts, including reduced sequencing costs, improved genome/metabolome mining strategies, and expanding tools/databases to compare and characterize chemical diversity. Steady advances in these fields are crucial for research on non-modal organisms such as lichen-forming fungi (LFF). Although most fungi produce bioactive metabolites, biosynthetic research on LFF (c.\u200921% of known fungi) lags behind, primarily due to experimental challenges. However, in recent years, several such challenges have been tackled, and, in parallel, a critical foundation of genomic data and pipelines has been established to accomplish the valorization of this potential. Integrating these concurrent advances to accelerate biochemical research in LFF provides a promising opportunity for new discoveries. This review summarizes the following: recent advances in fungal and LFF omics, and chemoinformatics research; studies on LFF biosynthesis, including chemical diversity and evolutionary/phylogenetic aspects; and experimental milestones in LFF biosynthetic gene functions.

Here, we generated 253 whole genome sequences and 22 reference genomes within the globally distributed ectomycorrhizal species complex Boletus edulis Bull. and use a multi-faceted genomic approach to identify patterns of ongoing hybridization and determine whether hybridization is mediated by changes in genome structure, ecology, or both. We found that hybridization is common among species of B. edulis despite 2.1 million years of divergence. However, not all lineages that hybridize today exhibit patterns of introgression, indicating the presence of strong reproductive boundaries among some species. Using a pan-genomic approach we find that genome structural variation is abundant within B. edulis, but that the presence of ongoing introgression does not correlate with genome structural similarity or overall gene content. Instead, we find that the composition of ecologically relevant gene families more accurately predicts the presence of introgression among lineages and B. edulis as a group may specialize on chitin decomposition.

Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii), a probiotic prescribed frequently in clinical settings, has been reported to trigger FPIES in an infant with soy-triggered FPIES. In this report, we describe a new clinical FPIES in which S. boulardii was the sole triggering factor of acute FPIES adverse reaction in seven healthy infants. CASE SUMMARY Seven FPIES cases triggered by only S. boulardii were gathered from 2011 to the present. None of the patients had previously experienced any allergic reaction to cow\u2019s milk, soy, or complementary food. The age of the patients was 4-10-months old, and the symptoms of FPIES developed after ingestion of S. boulardii, which is mostly prescribed for the treatment of gastroenteritis or antibiotic-associated diarrhea. All patients experienced severe repetitive vomiting 1-3 hours after S. boulardii ingestion. Extreme lethargy, marked pallor, and cyanosis were also observed. No IgE-mediated hypersensitivity developed in any patient. Diarrhea was followed by initial intense vomiting in approximately 5-10 hours after S. boulardii ingestion, and only one case showed bloody, purulent, and foul-smelling diarrhea. The patients stabilized quickly, mostly within 6 hours. Symptoms got all improved within 24 hours after discontinuation of S. boulardii. CONCLUSION S. boulardii can be the sole trigger of acute FPIES and be prescribed cautiously even in healthy children without FPIES.", "venue": "World Journal of Clinical Cases", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "CaseReport"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-26", "authors": [{"authorId": "2332068434", "name": "Jin-Bok Hwang"}, {"authorId": "2332766628", "name": "Hyo-Jeong Jang"}]}, {"paperId": "252d100835e0f8243128a5d138d1d2a45f9826bd", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2023.04.18.537338", "CorpusId": 276673337}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/252d100835e0f8243128a5d138d1d2a45f9826bd", "title": "WITHDRAWN: Purifying Selection and Persistent Polymorphism among Nuclei in the Multinucleate Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) Fungi", "abstract": "The authors have withdrawn this manuscript and do not wish it to be cited.

These mutualistic fungi typically do not cause significant damage to host trees; however, since their invasion into the U.S., the beetle Xyleborus glabratus has vectored its fungal partner, Harringtonia lauricola, which has acted as a devastating plant pathogen resulting in the deaths of over 500 million trees. Here, we show differences in the mycangial colonization of the indigenous X. affinis ambrosia beetle by H. lauricola, and the native fungal species, H. aguacate and Raffaelea arxii. While X. affinis was a good host for H. lauricola, the related ambrosia beetle, X. ferrugineus, was only marginally colonized by H. lauricola. X. affinis beetles neither fed on, nor were colonized by, the distantly related fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Mycangial colonization was affected by the nutritional state of the fungus. A novel method for direct quantification of mycangial contents based on image cell cytometry was developed and validated. The method was used to confirm mycangial colonization and demonstrate alternating fungal partner switching, which showed significant variation and dynamic turnover. X. affinis pre-oral mycangial pouches were visualized using fluorescent and light microscopy, revealing that newly emerged pupae displayed uncolonized mycangia prior to feeding, whereas beetles fed H. lauricola contained single-celled fungi within 6 h post-feeding. Mixed populations of fungal cells were seen in the mycangia of beetles following alternating colonization. Nuclear counter-staining revealed insect cells surrounding the mycangia.

In contrast, the addition of a composite detoxifier effectively ameliorated the reduction in ADG and ADFI in piglets caused by DON-polluted diets. It suppressed the reduction in CAT, SOD, GSH-PX, IL-4, and IL-10 and the elevation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, MDA, LPS, and DAO in serum; the composite detoxifier also restrained the decrease in SCFA in piglet faeces and increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, UCG-009, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group bacteria.

The impact of chemicals on soil health is often tested with the springtail reproduction test. We tested the effects of the trisiloxane Break-Thru\u00ae S 301 on the reproduction of Folsomia candida in three soils according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 232. Juveniles were extracted either by heat or flotation. In the latter method, recommended by OECD 232, test soil is flooded with water and stirred so that springtails float and swim on the water surface. Additionally, we tested the impact of Break-Thru\u00ae S 301 on other life-history endpoints linked with reproduction, namely reproduction investment and hatching success. We found a significant decline of recovered springtails at soil concentrations of Break-Thru\u00ae S 301 down to 2\u2009mg/kg in sandy soils when using flotation. However, using heat extraction no effects were found at the same concentrations. Also, reproduction investment and hatching success did not indicate any toxicity of Break-Thru\u00ae S 301 to springtails at all. In conclusion, Break-Thru\u00ae S 301 reduced the water surface tension in the flotation process so that springtail juveniles just sank and disappeared from the water surface. This artefact potentially can occur for all surfactants tested this way. We propose testing surfactant's impact on springtail flotation by adding a few drops of surfactant and observing springtails' sinking behaviour, before testing toxicity.

In this study, we investigated the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the adaptation of C. scutellarioides to cadmium stress, by measuring the physiological metabolism and the degree of root damage of C. scutellarioides, with Aspergillus oryzae as the test fungi. The results indicated that cadmium stress increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline (Pro) within the cells of C. scutellarioides, but inhibited mycorrhizal infestation rate, root vigour and growth rate to a great degree. With the same cadmium concentration, the inoculation of AMF significantly improved the physiological indexes of C. scutellarioides. The maximum decrease of MDA content was 42.16%, and the content of secondary metabolites rosemarinic acid and anthocyanosides could be increased by up to 27.43% and 25.72%, respectively. Meanwhile, the increase of root vigour was as high as 35.35%, and the DNA damage of the root system was obviously repaired. In conclusion, the inoculation of AMF can promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites, alleviate root damage, and enhance the tolerance to cadmium stress in C. scutellarioides.", "venue": "Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Yanan Hou"}, {"authorId": "2221419945", "name": "Fan Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2347055311", "name": "Shuyang Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2321052566", "name": "Dingyin Chen"}, {"authorId": "2346932303", "name": "Yijie Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2348114087", "name": "Yining Miao"}, {"authorId": "2346923638", "name": "Kai Ceng"}, {"authorId": "2347175561", "name": "Yifang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2347019839", "name": "Min Wu"}, {"authorId": "2347038153", "name": "Peng Liu"}]}, {"paperId": "ea10154ca5662612951e3c5de72806bf5b45e4b9", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1163/2049257x-20251015", "CorpusId": 276693572}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea10154ca5662612951e3c5de72806bf5b45e4b9", "title": "Yeast cell wall products effect on attachment of harmful foodborne strains of Salmonella to intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2)", "abstract": "\nYeast cell wall (YCW) prebiotics from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can be added to the diet of animals as an effective decoy molecule for Gram negative bacteria, helping to prevent colonisation of the gut by disease-causing organisms.

Several commercial yeast cell wall products, A, B and C, including a mannan rich fraction (MRF) product, were assessed for their ability to interfere with the attachment of Salmonella spp. to intestinal IPEC-J2 cells. Attachment of three serovars S. enterica Enteritidis, S. enterica Heidelberg, and S. enterica Typhimurium to IPEC-J2 cells was consistently inhibited with addition of MRF and, to a lesser extent, products B and C, while product A resulted in a greater attachment compared to the control.

However, products B and C had a more limited impact. Inversely IPEC-J2 cells in the presence of product A demonstrated higher inflammatory gene expression likely as a consequence of higher Salmonella attachment rates.

In contrast to a majority of species in the phylum Basidiomycota that have tetrapolar mating-type systems, the opportunistic human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans employs a bipolar mating-type system, with two mating types (a and \u03b1) determined by a single MAT locus that is unusually large (~120 kb) and contains more than 20 genes. While several MAT genes are associated with mating and sexual development, others control conserved cellular processes (e.g., cargo transport and protein synthesis), of which five (MYO2, PRT1, RPL22, RPL39, and RPO41) have been hypothesized to be essential. In this study, through genetic analysis involving sporulation of heterozygous diploid deletion mutants, as well as in some cases construction and analyses of conditional expression alleles of these genes, we confirmed that with the exception of MYO2, both alleles of the other four MAT genes are indeed essential for cell viability. We further showed that while MYO2 is not essential, its function is critical for infectious spore production, faithful cytokinesis, adaptation for growth at high temperature, and pathogenicity in vivo. Our results demonstrate the presence of essential genes in the MAT locus that are divergent between cells of opposite mating types. We discuss possible mechanisms to maintain functional alleles of these essential genes in a rapidly evolving genomic region in the context of fungal sexual reproduction and mating-type evolution.IMPORTANCESexual reproduction is essential for long-term evolutionary success.

In this study, we show that the a and \u03b1 alleles of four genes encoded in the MAT locus of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen C. neoformans are essential. We demonstrate that a fifth gene, MYO2, which had been predicted to be essential, is in fact dispensable for cell viability. However, a functional MYO2 allele is important for cytokinesis and fungal pathogenicity. Our study highlights the need for careful genetic analyses in determining essential genes, which is complementary to high-throughput approaches.

Search for articles was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, E-library scientific databases by following keywords: infectious diseases, atopic dermatitis, immune responses. Results. Systemic immune responses are the basis of pathogenic relationship between AD and infectious diseases. Atopic march includes bronchial asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or food intolerance. In adulthood, AD may be manifested by eczematous lesions of the hands\u2019 skin and allergic contact dermatitis. Epithelial barrier damage, increased concentrations of Th2/Th22 and cytokines, reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides, decreased bacterial diversity, prevalence of pathogens, as well as the use of immunosuppressive agents in therapy are the components of pathogenesis of allergic sensibilization and infectious pathology. Staphylococcus aureus is detected in 70\u201490% of cases in AD foci by bacteriological techniques, whereby some patients have predominantly methicillin-resistant S. aureus. A frequent presence of human papilloma virus, reduction of microbial diversity and colonies of Malassezia fungi are noted.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different temperatures (30\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, and 50\u00b0C) on the microbiomes of cigar tobacco leaves, providing insights into the complex interactions among temperature, microbes, and physicochemical metabolites.Firstly, the physicochemical metabolites of cigar tobacco leaves under various fermentation temperatures were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the impacts of different temperatures on microbial biomass and community structure were revealed by quantitative real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing, and the biomarkers at different fermentation temperatures were identified by LEfSe analysis. Finally, the functional potential of microbes was predicted by correlation analysis.The bacterial biomass increased initially and peaked at 8.4 \u00d7 109 copies/g at 35\u00b0C, then decreased as the temperature rose. The fungal biomass exhibited a downward trend with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum of 3.9 \u00d7 106 copies/g at 30\u00b0C. When the fermentation temperature exceeded 45\u00b0C, the growth of both bacteria and fungi was significantly restricted. Amplicon sequencing results indicated that Staphylococcus and Aspergillus genera dominated the bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. As the temperature increased, the relative abundance of Staphylococcus decreased first and then increased (46.1%\u201398.5%), while that of Aspergillus increased first and then decreased (34.9%\u201377.4%). Additionally, correlation analysis suggested that microbial communities shaped by different temperatures were responsible for the differences in physicochemical metabolites of cigar leaves. The biomarkers identified in the low-temperature fermentation group, including Staphylococcus, Stemphylium, Sampaiozyma, and Filobasidium, were likely responsible for the production of flavor metabolites, the accumulation of sugars, and the elevated ratio of potassium ions to chloride ions contents. Biomarkers in medium and high-temperature fermentation groups, such as Aspergillus, Neodymella, Acinetobacter, Pelomonas, Brevundimonas, and Alkalihalobacillus, might contribute to the degradation of nitrogen-containing substances and alkaloids.This study revealed the unique microbial community structure shaped at different temperatures and its potential correlation with physicochemical metabolites.

Although traditionally produced using lactic acid bacteria, yeasts offer significant advantages, such as higher tolerance to acidic environments, a broader substrate range, and the potential for genetic and metabolic engineering. This review explores the potential use of Lachancea thermotolerans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida utilis, and Pichia kudriavzevii as LA producers, highlighting their unique characteristics and industrial applications. S. cerevisiae stands out due to its robust genetic toolkit and acid tolerance, while K. marxianus offers thermotolerance and the efficient utilization of lactose and pentoses, making it ideal for high-temperature fermentations. K. lactis is particularly suited for valorizing dairy by-products like whey, P. kudriavzevii exhibits high tolerance to multiple stresses, while C. utilis demonstrates superior resilience to lignocellulosic inhibitors, enabling its use in biorefineries. Key challenges, including enhancing LA tolerance and optimizing metabolic pathways, are addressed through strategies like heterologous lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression, redox balance modification, and adaptive laboratory evolution. The review also discusses industrial applications, particularly in the context of circular economy approaches, where yeasts can convert waste streams into high-value LA.

Devising methods to improve treatment of these tissues could help with disease control. The objectives of this work were to: 1) investigate the extent to which fragmenting pathogen-infested crowns could improve fumigant disinfestation efficacy, 2) evaluate the efficacy of fumigation with chloropicrin alone (Tri-Clor) versus a mixture of chloropicrin and 1,3-dichloropropene (Pic-Clor 60), and 3) characterize the soil concentration and efficacy of fumigants at multiple depths. Fragmenting crowns did not result in improved disinfestation efficacy by any treatment. Neither fumigant achieved adequate Fusarium wilt disease control in the first trial, despite both treatments having high crown disinfestation efficacy. In the second trial, Pic-Clor 60 was significantly more effective than Tri-Clor at disinfesting Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. fragariae (Fof) from strawberry crowns and suppressing Fusarium wilt disease. Broadcast-applied Pic-Clor 60 was significantly more effective than Tri-Clor at controlling Macrophomina phaseolina on crowns and soil across both trials. However, drip-applied Pic-Clor 60 EC was not significantly better than Tri-Clor EC at disinfesting crowns, soil, or suppressing subsequent crown rot disease caused by M. phaseolina. Fumigant gas concentrations tended to be highest at the depth of injection (25 cm), and lowest at the 50 cm depth.

Rapid detection methods for ZEN mainly suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect of fluorescent materials. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for detecting ZEN. On this basis, we synthesised AIE polymer microspheres (AIEPMs) using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) dyes. We coupled these microspheres with antibodies to prepare immunoprobes to establish immunochromatographic test strips with a colorimetric/fluorescent dual mode. Under optimal parameters, the visual limit of detection (vLOD) for the colorimetric mode was 0.625 ng mL-1. In comparison, the quantitative limit of detection (qLOD) for the fluorescent mode was as low as 0.039 ng mL-1. The average recoveries ranged from 97.60% to 102.46%, and the coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 2.10% to 10.70%.

All R1 genes were actively transcribed, providing a series of loci with varying transcriptional activities. Here, we explore the use of R1 as a novel platform for stable, multi-gene integration and expression. By deleting three essential K. marxianus genes while complementing their functions with orthologs on R1, we achieved stable propagation of R1 in the absence of selective pressure. We characterized several loci on R1 that exhibit stable transcriptional activities under various conditions. GFP inserted in place of genes at six such loci demonstrated varying expression levels.

In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, PKA is a critical regulator of morphological transitions, which are a key virulence trait. PKA is composed of two catalytic isoforms, Tpk1 and Tpk2, which are often thought to act together in a complex with the regulatory subunit Bcy1. Although Tpk1 and Tpk2 have some redundant functions, they also have distinct cellular functions for which the mechanistic underpinnings remain largely elusive. Here, we constructed functional GFP-tagged fusion proteins for Tpk1, Tpk2, and Bcy1 to explore the localization of PKA isoforms. We observed that the PKA holoenzyme is mainly found in the cytoplasm, as Bcy1 is always excluded from the nucleus. Under glucose-replete conditions, both Tpk1 and Tpk2 translocate into the nucleus from the cytosol. In the presence of glycerol, Tpk1 resides in the cytosol, whereas Tpk2 and Bcy1 become enriched on the vacuolar membrane. As the C-terminal domains of Tpk are highly homologous, we investigated the localization and function of hybrid Tpk proteins with exchanged N-terminal domains. We found the catalytic C-terminus of Tpk1 is required for morphogenesis in solid medium, whereas the C-terminus of Tpk2 is critical for filamentation in liquid. Interestingly, the N-terminus of Tpk2 drives its localization to the vacuolar membrane. Our work highlights environmentally contingent localization patterns for the PKA subunits and suggests that the nuclear localization of Tpk is not sufficient to induce the filamentation program in a leading fungal pathogen of humans.IMPORTANCEFungal pathogens have a devastating impact on human health worldwide. They infect billions of people and kill more than 2.5 million per year. Candida albicans is a leading human fungal pathogen responsible for causing life-threatening systemic disease in immunocompromised individuals. A key virulence trait in C. albicans is the ability to switch between yeast and filamentous forms. The conserved protein kinase A (PKA) regulates diverse functions in the cell, including growth and filamentation. Although PKA has been studied in C. albicans for decades, the subcellular localization of PKA has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we constructed functional GFP-tagged PKA subunits to explore their localization. We identified differential localization patterns for the PKA subunits that are carbon-source dependent and report that these proteins localize into foci in response to diverse environmental stresses.

Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 282 HBV-ACLF patients admitted to the Hepatobiliary Internal Medicine Department of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, from May 2019 to December 2022, with 141 patients who had IAI and positive bacterial culture as the infected group; 141 non-infected patients admitted during the same period were used as the non-infected group. The clinical data, laboratory test results, pathogen species and drug sensitivity test results of the patients were collected, and the influencing factors of IAI in HBV-ACLF patients were analyzed by Logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 204 pathogenic bacteria were detected in the infection group, including 115 Gram-negative bacteria (56.37%), 74 Gram-positive bacteria (36.28%) and 15 fungi (7.35%). The most frequently detected bacterial genera were Escherichia coli (21.57%, 44/204), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.25%, 25/204), Enterococcus faecium (6.37%, 13/204), Staphylococcus aureus (5.39%, 11/204) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.90%, 10/204). The results of drug sensitivity tests showed that the resistance rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were over 50% and 30% respectively; the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) was 60.00%; the resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii to meropenem and imipenem were 100% and 50.00% respectively; the resistance rates of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis to penicillin were 100% and 33.33% respectively; and the resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin (77.78%) and oxacillin (33.33%) were relatively high..The results of the multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that puncture and drainage (OR=17.90, 95% CI: 7.94~43.42, P< 0.001), procalcitonin (OR=3.23, 95% CI: 1.56~8.98, P=0.012), C-reactive protein (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.02~1.00, P=0.003), and age (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.02~1.10, P=0.001) were independent risk factors for IAI in patients with HBV-ACLF. Conclusions The pathogenic microorganisms of HBV-ACLF patients with IAI were mainly enterobacteriaceae bacteria and enterococcus. Puncture drainage, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and age were independent risk factors for IAI in HBV-ACLF patients.

Factors that determine host specificity are diverse and range from molecular and morphological strategies to metabolic and reproductive adaptations. We applied an experimental approach and conducted comparative microscopy, transcriptome analyses, and functional analyses of selected pathogen traits to identify determinants of host specificity in an important wheat pathogen. We included three closely related fungal pathogens Zymoseptoria tritici, Z. pseudotritici, and Z. ardabiliae that establish compatible and incompatible interactions with wheat. Although infections of the incompatible species induce plant defenses during invasion of stomatal openings, we found a conserved early-infection program among the three species whereby only 9.2% of the 8,885 orthologous genes are significantly differentially expressed during initial infection. The genes up-regulated in Z. tritici likely reflect specialization to wheat, while upregulated genes in the incompatible interaction may reflect processes to counteract cellular stress associated with plant defenses. We selected nine candidate genes encoding putative effectors and host-specificity determinants in Z. tritici and deleted these to study their functional relevance. Despite the particular expression patterns of the nine genes, only two mutants were impaired in virulence. We further expressed the Z. tritici proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate protein function and assess cell death reaction. Hereby, we identify three effectors with cell-death-inducing properties. From the functional analyses, we conclude that the successful infection of Z. tritici in wheat relies on an extensive redundancy of virulence determinants.", "venue": "Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "7218351", "name": "Janine Haueisen"}, {"authorId": "2056349134", "name": "Mareike M\u00f6ller"}, {"authorId": "50198845", "name": "Heike Seybold"}, {"authorId": "2347302628", "name": "Corinn Small"}, {"authorId": "2347313258", "name": "Mira Wilkens"}, {"authorId": "2347311335", "name": "Lovis Jahneke"}, {"authorId": "2347308639", "name": "Leonhard Pachinger"}, {"authorId": "4732943", "name": "Elisha Thynne"}, {"authorId": "6802296", "name": "E.

Although highly conserved throughout many eukaryotes, their functions vary across species. In Aspergillus fumigatus, the etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis, septins participate in a variety of processes such as cell wall organization of conidia, septation, and response to cell wall stress. Previous studies determined that the \u0394aspB strain had a greater sensitivity to anti-cell wall drugs, especially the echinocandin caspofungin, yet mechanisms behind this augmented sensitivity are unknown. We performed cell viability staining of the deletion strains post-caspofungin exposure and found that the \u0394aspA, \u0394aspB, and \u0394aspC strains have significantly lower cell viability. Concomitant with the reduced viability, deletion strains are more susceptible to caspofungin on solid media. These results indicate that the septin cytoskeleton is important for A. fumigatus survival in the presence of caspofungin. Due to the potential of improved therapeutic outcome, we followed up using a neutropenic murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Animals infected with the \u0394aspB strain and treated with caspofungin showed improved survival compared to the animals infected with akuBKU80 wild-type or complemented strains. Additionally, histological analysis showed reduced fungal burden and inflammation in the \u0394aspB infected, caspofungin-treated group. Affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics identified proteins involved in the septin-dependent response to caspofungin, includng four candidate interactors involved in cell wall stress response. Deletion of these candidate genes resulted in increased susceptibility to caspofungin and moderately reduced viability post-drug exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that septin AspB contributes to the fungistatic response to caspofungin. Author Summary Invasive aspergillosis is a pulmonary disease caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that primarily occurs in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis has a high mortality rate, ranging from 50-90%. Therapy options are limited due to few available drugs with fungicidal activity and growing global drug resistance. Treatment typically starts with triazoles, which target the fungal cell membrane. If unsuccessful, an echinocandin, which targets the cell wall, is given as a salvage therapy. Echinocandins, including caspofungin, are fungistatic against A. fumigatus, slowing growth of the fungus rather than killing it. Due to this, echinocandins have a high therapeutic failure rate. Previous work suggests that deletion of the cytoskeletal septin genes increases sensitivity to caspofungin. Here we describe our finding that the septin genes aspA, aspB, and aspC are involved in the fungal response to caspofungin. Additionally, the deletion of aspB results in fungicidal activity of this otherwise fungistatic drug. These findings show promise for novel therapy options that block the septin-mediated response to caspofungin.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2290288644", "name": "R.

Mucor circinelloides is a model organism for studying lipogenesis and it particularly promising for its metabolic capabilities in producing oils like TAGs and carotenoids, influenced by environmental factors such as nutrient availability. Notably, strains VI04473 and FRR5020 have been identified for their potential in producing single-cell oils and carotenoids, respectively. Calcium starvation have previously been shown to have strain-specific effects, with VI04473 accumulating more lipids and FRR5020 producing more carotenoids. Here we used genome sequencing, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolite phenotyping to explore the genetic basis of lipid and carotenoid production under calcium starvation in these strains. We found extensive genomic rearrangements between these strains, as well as low conservation of gene regulatory responses to calcium depletion. This lack of conservation also applies to genes involved in lipid and carotenoid production, i.e. the lipidome. Several pathways show divergent regulation between strains, which explains the phenotypic divergence between VI04473 and FRR5020. The complex gene family evolution of several lipidome genes probably also affected specialization of these strains to calcium stress. Our study sheds light on the complexity of the evolution of metabolic networks in M. circinelloides. Understanding these genetic underpinnings can optimize the industrial use of M. circinelloides, enhancing lipid productivity and stress tolerance, and tailoring metabolic profiles for specific applications.

The genetic diversity of modern cultivars has been eroded by domestication and selection, increasing their vulnerability to biotic stress due to uniformity. The rapid spread of new highly virulent and aggressive pathogen strains has exacerbated this situation. Three strategies can be used for enhancing disease resistance through genome editing: introducing resistance (R) gene-mediated resistance, engineering nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), and manipulating susceptibility (S) genes to stop pathogens from exploiting these factors to support infection. Utilizing R gene-mediated resistance is the most common strategy for traditional breeding approaches, but the continuous evolution of pathogen effectors can eventually overcome this resistance. Moreover, modifying S genes can confer pleiotropic effects that hinder their use in agriculture. Enhancing disease resistance is paramount for sustainable wheat production and food security, and new tools and strategies are of great importance to the research community. The application of CRISPR-based genome editing provides promise to improve disease resistance, allowing access to a broader range of solutions beyond random mutagenesis or intraspecific variation, unlocking new ways to improve crops, and speeding up resistance breeding. Here, we first summarize the major disease resistance strategies in the context of important wheat diseases and their limitations.

Fungal bioagents play an important role in managing phytopathogens and insect pests by acting as biological agents.

Furthermore, fungal bioagents are environmentally friendly, reducing application of fungicides and insecticides\u00a0and minimizing their negative impact on the crops and environment. Their use in IPM promotes sustainable agriculture and ensures high-quality crops while maintaining soil health and microbial biodiversity.

While these gradients have been well documented for macroorganisms, there is limited consensus about their universality, shape and drivers for microorganisms, such as fungi, despite the importance of fungal diversity for ecosystem functions and services. We conducted a comprehensive survey of fungal species richness in forests across 17 elevational transects along a latitudinal gradient covering the continental scale of Europe. Diversity patterns along elevational and latitudinal gradients differed among fungal ecological guilds. Diversity of saprotrophs declined with elevation while ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal diversity peaked in mid-elevations. Moreover, the diversity of root endophytic fungi increased with latitude but did not change with elevation. Bayesian species distribution modeling suggests that fungal diversity is structured by deterministic rather than stochastic drivers. Importantly, ECM fungal diversity pattern persists even after accounting for the effects of environmental conditions. These results suggest that environmental conditions differentially shape the diversity of fungal guilds along elevational and latitudinal gradients, but this goes beyond soil and climatic factors in the case of ECM fungi.

Blackberry virus diseases limit the lifespan of blackberry production in the southeastern United States.

Additionally, the role of wild Rubus as sources of virus inoculum is likely under-appreciated and represents a potential opportunity for disease management. We took a comprehensive approach to characterize viral genome sequences from known and novel viruses using metatranscriptomic sequencing of blackberry and wild Rubus spp. leaf samples collected in 2021 from eight sites across South Carolina. We detected 17 known and 6 novel plant viruses and describe relevant genome sequence information. Although the etiologies of these novel viruses are yet to be elucidated, they should be considered part of the blackberry/wild Rubus virome and further studied. We describe instances of potential connectivity of virus populations between cultivated blackberry and wild Rubus for several viruses at several sites. In addition to plant viruses, we also describe numerous viruses likely associated with foliar fungi, referred to as Rubus leaf-associated viruses.

The microbial reduction of selenium salts to SeNPs has great potential, while there is a lack of elite strains. In this study, we explored the reduction of Na2SeO3 by Streptomyces avermitilis into SeNPs. The colonies and hyphae of the strain and the synthesized SeNPs were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At the same time, the inhibitory activity of SeNPs on Fusarium oxysporum, the main pathogen causing root rot of Lycium barbarum, was studied. The results showed that S. avermitilis converted Na2SeO3 into SeNPs and tolerated 300 mmol/L Na2SeO3, demonstrating strong tolerance. S. avermitilis synthesized spherical SeNPs in the cytoplasm, and most of SeNPs had a diameter of about 100 nm and were released by hyphal fracture. The SeNPs synthesized by S. avermitilis were amorphous, and their surfaces were dominated by C and Se, with the existence of O, N and other elements. SeNPs had functional groups such as -OH, C=O, C-N, and C-H, which were closely related to the stability and biological activity of SeNPs. The SeNPs synthesized by S. avermitilis showcased significant inhibitory activity on F. oxysporum, and 25.0 \u03bcmol/mL SeNPs showcased the inhibition rate of 77.61% and EC50 of 0.556 \u03bcmol/mL. In conclusion, S. avermitilis can tolerate high Na2SeO3 stress and mediate the synthesis of SeNPs.

An associated mortality of \u223c45%, rising drug resistance and massive nosocomial outbreaks complicate clinical treatment. A critical bottleneck in understanding virulence is the lack of gene expression profiling models during in vivo host tissue infection. We developed a thermo-relevant fish embryo yolk-sac (Aphanius dispar; Arabian killifish; AK) microinjection model at human body temperature featuring clinically relevant features of host immunity. This allowed us to interrogate infection dynamics through dual host-pathogen RNA-seq at 24 and 48 h post injection (HPI) at 37 \u00b0C across five major clades (I-V) of C. auris. Host responses to infection featured heat shock, complement activation, and nutritional immunity, including haem oxygenase (HMOX) expression in response to clade IV infection. We identified an in vivo transcriptional signature across five clades of C. auris that was highly enriched for putative xenosiderophore transmembrane transporters. We describe this newly-discovered seventeen-member xenosiderophore transporter candidate (XTC) family in terms of individual gene expression patterns, and a sub-clade of five putative haem transport-related (HTR) genes. Only the basal clade V isolate formed filaments during infection, coinciding with typical and atypical regulators of morphogenesis, including UME6, HGC1, and the novel adhesin SCF1. Clades I and IV demonstrated increased virulence, coinciding with up-regulation of three HTR genes in clade IV, and the mating-type locus (MTL) non-mating gene PIKA in both. Our study provides critical insights into the pathogenesis of C. auris, including species-wide up-regulation of XTC and HTR genes during clinically relevant in vivo host tissue infection. Significance statement Candida auris is an emerging human fungal pathogen and global public health threat, but in vivo tissue infection transcriptome analysis has not been achieved with available models. We infected Arabian killifish yolk-sacs to study gene expression programmes by five clades of C. auris. We discovered that the basal clade V uniquely filamented during infection. Additionally, all clades encode a large expanded family of xenosiderophore transporters that are upregulated during infection. These results highlight the important roles for morphology switching and iron acquisition during infection, both of which shed light on its mechanisms of infection and could make novel drug targets.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/10/23/2024.10.22.619744.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2161389497", "name": "H.

C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes. Importance Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is found in the gut of most individuals. C. albicans has been shown to contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Outside of this, the impact of intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, C. albicans, can alter mammalian ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E2. The results highlight novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2241419809", "name": "Andrew W Day"}, {"authorId": "2347755333", "name": "Jeyra Perez-Lozada"}, {"authorId": "2347732278", "name": "Alyssa DiLeo"}, {"authorId": "2289950000", "name": "Katrina Blandino"}, {"authorId": "2333566713", "name": "Jamie L.

Many antifungal drugs are available to treat this infection but in routine clinical practice, these antifungal drugs are not always effective. For this reason, antifungal susceptibility test is an epidemiological concern to reduce the dermatophytic infection. Objective: This study was aimed to evaluate the susceptibility patterns of Tricophyton Rubrum and Tricophyton Mentagrophytes to antifungal drugs. Methods: To determine the pattern of antifungal susceptibility in dermatophytes, this study comprised 246 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dermophytoses across all age groups. The skin, hair, and nails were sampled in an aseptic manner. These samples were mounted in potassium hydroxide (KOH) and cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). Direct microscopy and culture method were used in diagnosis of dermatophytosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and biochemical tests (urease test and hair perforation test) were used to identify dermatophyte species. An established colony was cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for sensitivity testing. Following notable sporulation, the spores were collected in normal saline and a standardized inoculum adjusted with 0.5 Mcfarland solution was applied to SDA plates, which were then incubated at room temperature (26-28\u02daC). After three to seven days, the zone of inhibition was evaluated and the drug's sensitivity, intermediate level, or resistance was determined accordingly. Results: It was observed that, thirty-one (93.55%) Trichophyton rubrum and 45 (91.11%) Trichophyton mentagrophytes were resistant to fluconazole.

Nine landraces from high-altitude agriculture in the Jumla district in western Nepal (29.27443900, 82.19332200; 2540 m msl) and one genotype of commercial common bean from the sub-tropical Chitwan district in central Nepal (27.65186564, 84.34869288; 256 m masl) were evaluated for resistance against the pathogen under screenhouse and field conditions.

Free forms of fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1+ FB2), and free zearalenone (ZEN) together with three of its enteric metabolites have been identified as fitting indicators for exposures to the parent mycotoxins. This study investigated the similarities in regional and age-related mycotoxin exposures among sampled females employed in the cereal value chain in Ghana. After obtaining ethical clearance to conduct the study, spot urine samples were collected from females in cereal growing communities in The Upper West, Northern, Ashanti and Greater Accra regions of Ghana. The collected bio-samples were processed appropriately and LC- MS/MS chromatographic methods used to determine the presence and levels of FB1, FB2, ZEN, -ZEL, {beta}-ZEL and ZEN-14, glucuronide. The results indicate that while probable daily intake of the mycotoxins decreased with age, being higher for the 10-19 age groups, exposures were higher in the 55+ age group, consistent with age-related accumulation. The creatinine adjusted mycotoxin levels also presented a snapshot of renal function across the four regions being generally homogenous for participants in the Ashanti region. Wide variations in creatinine concentrations were observed for the Upper West and Northern regions and the spread was heterogenous for Greater Accra. The insight into renal function alongside age-related mycotoxin exposures agrees with previous findings of significant links between FB1 exposures and adverse health outcomes. ZEN exposures were higher in the 10-19 age group suggesting the potential for younger age groups to face significant risks due to exposure to the mycoestrogen.

Under moderate salinity, inoculation of L. bicolor increased root biomass by 4.55% and leaf chlorophyll concentrations by 46.8%, and decreased leaf Na+ concentrations and the Na+/K+ ratios. Under high salinity, L. bicolor decreased leaf water content and fluorescence parameters, and increased leaf Na+ concentrations. The effect of ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor on Q. dentata seedlings was dependent on NaCl concentration, and our results indicate that the use of L. bicolor in afforestation efforts with Q. dentata would only be effective under relatively low soil salinity levels.", "venue": "Forests", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347549741", "name": "Wenlong Sun"}, {"authorId": "2186441656", "name": "Luyu Qi"}, {"authorId": "2347430400", "name": "Haonan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2236732720", "name": "Yixin Song"}, {"authorId": "2347769721", "name": "Jiaqi Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2347412538", "name": "Puyi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2347566134", "name": "Bojian Wang"}, {"authorId": "2347623139", "name": "Qiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2347466218", "name": "Gaode Meng"}, {"authorId": "2347348755", "name": "Tianyu Ji"}, {"authorId": "2051328060", "name": "Xinke Sun"}, {"authorId": "2311109061", "name": "Weihua Guo"}, {"authorId": "3167536", "name": "N.

In the present study, the chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil isolated from this species were determined. The essential oil was extracted through hydrodistillation. The chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of the essential oil were determined by gas chromatography. Antimicrobial activity was determined using the broth microdilution method against tree Gram-positive cocci, a Gram-positive bacillus, four Gram-negative bacilli, a fungus, and a yeast. The antioxidant activity was determined through ABTS (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) methods. The spectrophotometric method was used to determine anticholinesterase activity. In the essential oil, thirty-nine compounds were identified, which represented 99.35% of the total composition. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most representative group in terms of number of compounds (thirteen) and in terms of relative abundance (91.39%). The main constituents were found to be limonene (57.38 \u00b1 1.09%), \u03b3-terpinene (13.01 \u00b1 0.37%), and \u03b2-pinene (12.04 \u00b1 0.63%).

Aerosols, including biological aerosols, exert a significant influence on cloud formation, influencing the global climate through their effects on radiative balance and precipitation. The Arctic region features persistent mixed-phase clouds, which are impacted by ice nucleating particles (INPs) that modulate the phase transitions within clouds, affecting their lifetime and impacting the region's climate. An increasing number of studies document that Arctic soils harbor numerous biogenic INPs (bioINPs), but these have yet to be linked to their microbial producers. In addition, the transfer of bioINPs from soils into freshwater and marine systems has not been quantified. This study aimed to address these open questions by analyzing soil and freshwater samples from northeast Greenland to determine the microbial composition along with the INP concentrations and size distributions. We found that soils contained between 3.19\u00d7104 and 1.55\u00d7106\u2009INP\u2009g\u22121 soil, which was on the lower side of what has previously been reported for active-layer soils. The composition of INPs varied widely across locations and could have originated from bacterial and fungal sources. We detected Mortierella, a fungal genus known to produce ice nucleating proteins, at nearly all locations. Spearman correlations between soil taxa and INP concentrations pointed at lichenized fungi as a possible contributor to soil INP. Additionally, based on the INP size distribution, we suggest that soil INPs were bound to soil particles or microbial membranes at some locations, while other locations showed a variety of soluble INPs with different molecular sizes. In streams, INP concentrations were comparable to what has previously been measured in streams from temperate regions. Interestingly, stream INP concentrations showed a positive association with soil INP concentrations. The potential release and aerosolization of these bioINPs into the atmosphere \u2013 whether directly from the soil, from streams into which they are washed, or from the oceans where they might be transported \u2013 could impact cloud formation and precipitation patterns in the Arctic. This research contributes valuable knowledge to the understanding of microbial communities and the potential microbial producers of highly active bioINPs in Arctic soils and their connectivity with Arctic streams.\n", "venue": "Aerosol Research", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2151072391", "name": "Lasse Z.

Proliferation of C. neoformans within mammalian hosts is supported by its ability to overcome nutritional limitations and endure stress conditions induced by the host immune response. Previously, we reported that the Vam6/Vps39/TRAP1-domain protein Vam6 was crucial for vacuolar morphology, iron acquisition, and virulence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic phenotypes resulting from loss of Vam6 remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined that Vam6 has roles in the HOPS complex for endomembrane trafficking to the vacuole and in the vCLAMP membrane contact site between the vacuole and mitochondria. Importantly, both of these roles regulate polyphosphate (polyP) metabolism, as demonstrated by a defect in trafficking of the VTC complex subunit Vtc2 for polyphosphate synthesis and by an influence on mitochondrial functions. In the latter case, Vam6 was required for polyP accumulation in response to electron transport chain inhibition and for overcoming oxidative stress. Overall, this work establishes connections between endomembrane trafficking, mitochondrial functions, and polyP homeostasis in C. neoformans.IMPORTANCEA detailed understanding of stress resistance by fungal pathogens of humans may provide new opportunities to improve antifungal therapy and combat life-threatening diseases. Here, we used a vam6 deletion mutant to investigate the role of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex in mitochondrial functions and polyphosphate homeostasis in Cryptococcus neoformans, an important fungal pathogen of immunocompromised people including those suffering from HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we made use of mutants defective in late endocytic trafficking steps to establish connections to oxidative stress and membrane trafficking with mitochondria. In particular, we found that mutants lacking the Vam6 protein had altered mitochondrial function, and that the mutants were perturbed for additional mitochondria and vacuole-related phenotypes (e.g., membrane composition, polyphosphate accumulation, and drug sensitivity).

Baicalein, a flavonoid derived from baicalin found in Scutellaria baicalensis, has demonstrated considerable antifungal efficacy. Moreover, the combination of baicalein and fluconazole demonstrated a notable synergistic effect. Given the restricted natural accessibility of baicalein, Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been identified as a microbial agent capable of converting baicalin to baicalein via whole-cell catalysis. This process has been shown to achieve a molar yield of 66% at a substrate concentration of 4\u202fg/L under optimized conditions. In addition to the antifungal properties of baicalein, L. rhamnosus demonstrated intrinsic antifungal activity against C. albicans. The combination of baicalein and L. rhamnosus resulted in a notable enhancement in the inhibition of C. albicans growth. The key enzyme responsible for baicalin hydrolysis, \u03b2-glucuronidase (LrGUS2), is indicative of the biotransformation potential of L. rhamnosus. This study demonstrates the potent antifungal activity of baicalein, its synergistic effects with fluconazole, and the ability of L. rhamnosus to efficiently convert baicalin into baicalein.

This approach facilitates the replication of natural niches of ecological or clinical relevance where microbes consistently interact. In this context, increasing attention has been addressed toward elucidating the molecular crosstalk within fungal co-cultures. However, a major challenge in this area of research is determining the fungal origin of metabolites induced in co-cultivation systems. Molecules elicited in co-cultures may not be detectable in the individual cultures, making it challenging to establish which microorganism is responsible for their induction. For agar-diffused metabolites, imaging mass spectrometry can help overcome this obstacle by localizing the induced molecules during fungal confrontations. For volatile metabolites, however, this remains an open problem. To address this issue, in this study, a three-head-to-head co-culture strategy was developed, specifically focusing on the exploration of volatile interactions between fungi via headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry. This methodology was applied to study the volatile molecular interactions of three fungal species: Fusarium culmorum, Aspergillus amstelodami, and Cladosporium cladosporioides. The adopted strategy revealed a Fusarium-specific induction of three volatile molecules: \u03b3-terpinene and two unidentified sesquiterpene compounds. Interestingly, \u03b3-terpinene showed antifungal activity in a bioassay against the other two fungal species: Aspergillus amstelodami and Cladosporium cladosporioides. The proposed methodology could help to investigate volatile molecular interactions and highlight metabolite induction specific to a particular fungus involved in in vitro fungal confrontations. This is relevant for a better understanding of the complex biosynthetic responses of fungi in consortia and for identifying volatile molecules with antifungal activity.", "venue": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "2931732", "name": "A.

Due to their low biomass and other obstacles, the presence of intratumor microbes has been challenging to definitively establish. However, advances in biotechnology have enabled researchers to reveal the association between intratumor microbiota and cancer. Recent studies have shown that tumor tissues, once thought to be sterile, actually contain various microorganisms. Disrupted mucosal barriers and adjacent normal tissues are important sources of intratumor microbiota. Additionally, microbes can invade tumors by traveling through the bloodstream to the tumor site and infiltrating through damaged blood vessels. These intratumor microbiota may promote the initiation and progression of cancers by inducing genomic instability and mutations, affecting epigenetic modifications, activating oncogenic pathways, and promoting inflammatory responses. This review summarizes the latest advancements in this field, including techniques and methods for identifying and culturing intratumor microbiota, their potential sources, functions, and roles in the efficacy of immunotherapy.

The seed-borne pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi causes seed decay disease during pre-harvest and post-harvest stages of soybean, leading to a significant reduction in yield and quality. Therefore, it is very meaningful to characterize the diversity and function of the GmFAD gene family in soybean and to elucidate their roles in seed resistance to F. fujikuroi.In this study, 30 full-length GmFAD genes were identified from the soybean genome. A range of analysis was conducted to characterize gene and protein structures, chromosomal locations, conserved motif and conserved structural domains, and results showed that GmFAD genes were clustered into seven subfamilies (FAB2, ADS, SLD, DES, FAD6, FAD2, FAD3/7/8), which is also supported by phylogenetic analysis. The diversity and expansion of the GmFAD gene family were mainly caused by segmental duplication, and their encoding proteins were observed to locate in chloroplast or endoplasmic reticulum. The promoters of GmFAD genes contained a set of cis-acting elements in response to plant hormone, defense and stress, light, and plant growth and development, indicating these genes have the complex expression regulation and diverse functions. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment pathway analyses showed that GmFAD genes were closely related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of lipid and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). In addition, the expression of GmFADs was significantly changed in soybean seeds when challenged by the seed decay pathogen F. fujikuroi. Specifically, GmFAB2.1/2.2, GmFAD3.3/3-2B/7-1//8-2, and GmFAD2.3/2.5 genes displayed distinct temporal expression patterns in the resistant ND25 and susceptible CX12, highlighting their potential roles in soybean resistance against F. fujikuroi infection.Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the GmFAD gene family and their intricate roles in soybean resistance against the seed-borne pathogen F. fujikuroi.

Powerful mapping approaches such as bulk segregant analysis, wherein individuals with extreme phenotypes are pooled for genotyping, obscure epistasis by averaging over genotype combinations. To accurately characterize and quantify epistasis underlying natural trait variation, we have engineered strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enable crosses where one parent's chromosome is fixed while the rest of the chromosomes segregate. These crosses allow us to use bulk segregant analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) whose effects depend on alleles on the fixed parental chromosome, indicating a genetic interaction with that chromosome. Our method, which we term epic-QTL (for epistatic-with-chromosome QTL) analysis, can thus identify interaction loci with high statistical power. Here we perform epic-QTL analysis of copper resistance with chromosome I or VIII fixed in a cross between divergent naturally derived strains. We find seven loci that interact significantly with chromosome VIII and none that interact with chromosome I, the smallest of the 16 budding yeast chromosomes. Each of the seven interactions alters the magnitude, rather than the direction, of an additive QTL effect. We also show that fixation of one source of variation-in this case chromosome VIII, which contains the large-effect QTL mapping to CUP1-increases power to detect the contributions of other loci to trait differences.", "venue": "Genetics", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2087121945", "name": "Cassandra Buzby"}, {"authorId": "4492856", "name": "Y.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of a cationic arginine-based gemini surfactant, C9(LA)2, against mixed biofilms of fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli, and the preventive effect of this surfactant impregnated in CVCs on the formation of inter-kingdom biofilms. Methods: Broth microdilution assays were performed along with evaluation of the effect against mixed biofilms in formation. The impregnation of CVCs with the surfactant and with a hydrogel containing the cationic surfactant was investigated to assess their potential to prevent the formation of mixed biofilms. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also utilized. Results: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for resistant C. albicans ranged from 4\u20135.3 \u00b5g/mL, while for E. coli, the MICs varied from 85.3 to 298.7 \u00b5g/mL. Fungicidal and bactericidal action patterns were obtained. In mixed biofilm formation in 96-well plates, there was a significant reduction in the colony-forming unit (CFU) count. The impregnation of the CVC with C9(LA)2 alone resulted in a biofilm reduction of 62% versus C. albicans and 48.7% against E. coli in terms of CFUs. When the CVC was impregnated with the surfactant hydrogel, the effect was improved with an inhibition of 71.7% for C. albicans and 86.7% for E. coli. The images obtained by SEM corroborated the results.

Each year, in various countries, cacao cultivation faces issues such as moniliasis (Moniliophthora roreri), which reduces crop yields. Traditional disease control methods are ineffective, necessitating new alternatives, such as the application of Trichoderma spp. \n\u00a0 \nMethod: The antagonistic capacity of forty native endophyte Trichoderma isolates against M. roreri was evaluated. The ten best-performing strains were sprayed on healthy cacao pods. The number of pods affected by moniliasis, healthy pods, and the internal and external severity of infected pods were assessed. \n\u00a0 \nResults and Discussion: 32.5% of the Trichoderma strains inhibited more than 90% of the radial growth of M. roreri. All Trichoderma isolates showed high antagonistic activity. The evaluated isolates increased the number of healthy pods, while six strains reduced moniliasis by up to 35%. The severity of M. roreri was lower in treated pods compared to the untreated control pods. \n\u00a0 \nResearch Implications: The study results highlight the need for continued evaluation of Trichoderma strains to develop a future tool for reducing M. roreri infections in plantations of small and medium-sized farmers. \n\u00a0 \nOriginality/Value: Few studies on local endophytic strains of Trichoderma spp. have been conducted in the study area.", "venue": "Revista de Gest\u00e3o Social e Ambiental", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347079883", "name": "Raquel Guerrero"}, {"authorId": "2347081397", "name": "Roxanna Patricia Palma"}, {"authorId": "2115018455", "name": "Orly Cevallos Falquez"}, {"authorId": "2347081368", "name": "Cecilia M\u00f3naco"}]}, {"paperId": "e7429200661ed79c1d92f0127431a07a57337739", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s00203-025-04266-7", "CorpusId": 276567352, "PubMed": "39992431"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7429200661ed79c1d92f0127431a07a57337739", "title": "The immune response of upper and lower airway epithelial cells to Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans-derived \u03b2-glucan in Th17 type cytokine environment.", "abstract": null, "venue": "Archives of Microbiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346915645", "name": "Murat Turkbey"}, {"authorId": "150969519", "name": "Dilara Karaguzel"}, {"authorId": "2277715092", "name": "Ali Doruk Uzunkaya"}, {"authorId": "2346915176", "name": "Yusuf Doruk Aracagok"}, {"authorId": "2254215529", "name": "Cagatay Karaaslan"}]}, {"paperId": "e4032343259b58781ed5bde70a6edef9fd2be43c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1139/cjps-2024-0234", "CorpusId": 276597582}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4032343259b58781ed5bde70a6edef9fd2be43c", "title": "CDC Rider green field pea", "abstract": "CDC Rider, a green cotyledon field pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar, was released in 2021 by the Crop Development Centre, University of Saskatchewan for distribution to Select seed growers through the Variety Release Committee of the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers.

In view of the diversity of clinical manifestations in patients with TM infection, early diagnosis remains challenging. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a novel immunohistochemical staining by performing CD86 immunohistochemical staining on 56 tissue sections from patients with talaromycosis who had fungal culture or metagenomic next-generation sequencing confirmed to exist in clinical specimens, as well as 26 patients with other fungi that had been culture-proven. Hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stains were also applied to each specimen. We found that anti-CD86 antibody can label TM pathogens in 38 HIV-negative specimens (38/42) and 14 HIV-positive specimens (14/14); conversely, PAS staining yielded positive results in seven cases of HIV-negative specimens (7/42) and 13 cases of HIV-positive specimens (13/14). Additionally, CD86 immunohistochemical staining was negative in other fungi. Importantly, CD86 immunohistochemical staining significantly outperformed PAS staining in terms of localizing and highlighting TM yeasts, as well as demonstrating the specificity of 100% and a significantly higher sensitivity compared to PAS staining at 92.9% versus 35.7% (P < 0.05, McNemar test). Our findings suggest that CD86 immunohistochemical staining has the potential for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis.IMPORTANCETalaromycosis is an opportunistic endemic disease without typical clinical manifestations that has emerged as a fungal disease impacting the survival and mortality of immunocompromised individuals and HIV-positive individuals in endemic regions. Nonetheless, talaromycosis is completely curable if it is accurately diagnosed and treated effectively at an early stage.

Because of potential effects on crop productivity, the toxic effects of heavy metals (HMs) in Trichoderma are of interest. However, there have been few studies on the biochemical and molecular response to oxidation caused by exposure to copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) and whether this antioxidant response is species-specific. In this study, we compared the tolerance of Trichoderma asperellum and Trichoderma longibrachiatum to Cu, Pb, and Cr and evaluated the expression of genes related to the antioxidant response, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and cysteine synthase (CYS) as well as the activity of peroxidase and catalase. The isolates of Trichoderma were selected because we previously reported them as promotors of plant growth and agents of biological control. Our results revealed that, with exposure to the three HMs, the Trichoderma cultures formed aggregates and the culture color changed according to the metal and the Trichoderma species. The tolerance index (TI) indicated that the two Trichoderma species were tolerant of HMs (Cu > Cr > Pb). However, the TI and conidia production revealed that T. longibrachiatum was more tolerant of HMs than T. asperellum. The three HMs caused oxidative damage in both Trichoderma species, but the enzyme activity and gene expression were differentially regulated based on exposure time (72 and 144 h) to the HMs and Trichoderma species. The main changes occurred in T. asperellum; the maximum expression of the GPX gene occurred at 144 h in response to all three HMs, whereas the CAT gene was upregulated at 72 h in response to Cu but downregulated at 144 h in response to all three HMs. The CYS gene was upregulated in response to the three metals. The peroxidase activity increased with all three HMs, but the catalase activity increased with Cu and Pb at 72 h and decreased at 144 h with Pb and Cr. In T. longibrachiatum, the GPX gene was upregulated with all three HMs at 72 h, the CAT gene was upregulated only with Pb at 72 h and was downregulated at 144 h with HMs. Cr and Cu upregulated CYS gene expression, but expression did not change with Pb. The peroxidase activity increased with Cu at 144 h and with Cr at 72 h, whereas Pb decreased the enzyme activity. In contrast, catalase activity increased with the three metals at 144 h. In conclusion, T. longibrachiatum was more tolerant of Cu, Cr, and Pb than was T. asperellum, but exposure to all three HMs caused oxidative damage to both Trichoderma species. Peroxidases and catalases were activated, and the expression of the genes GPX and CYS was upregulated, whereas the CAT gene was downregulated.

Notably, in relation to NBs, blue light significantly increased the antimicrobial potential compared to white LED; moreover, a curcumin concentrationdependent effect was highlighted (50 \u00b5g/mL with respect to 25 \u00b5g/mL). No significant differences were presented applying NCs.

Traditionally, it has been produced through silanization reactions or by coating the glass with polymers. But these approaches involve toxic chemicals and result in films that are prone to hydrolysis upon long\u2010term exposure to water. In this report, a novel, simple method for functionalizing glass using ultrasonication of aryl diazonium salts is introduced. When these salts are exposed to ultrasound under mild conditions (24\u00a0kHz/400\u00a0W), aryl radicals are generated, which spontaneously react with the glass surface. This reaction forms a thin organic polymeric film whose surface properties, such as hydrophobicity or charge, can be tailored by the terminal group of the diazonium salt employed. The film is covalently bonded to the glass surface via Si\u2013O\u2013C bonds, which offer enhanced stability compared to the more hydrolysis\u2010prone Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds that govern traditional silanization techniques. This newly functionalized glass is shown to adhere microorganisms such as microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris C. vulgaris), bacteria (Escherichia coli, E. coli), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae), suggesting potential applications in enzyme production, filtration, environmental remediation technologies, biofuels, and biofuel cells.", "venue": "Advanced Functional Materials", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2143600035", "name": "Tiexin Li"}, {"authorId": "2184983773", "name": "Zane Datson"}, {"authorId": "2347637781", "name": "Sufia Hena"}, {"authorId": "2347704643", "name": "Steven Chang"}, {"authorId": "2347635498", "name": "Shane Werry"}, {"authorId": "2347690932", "name": "Leqi Zhao"}, {"authorId": "16107681", "name": "N.

This study aims to analyze the host range and geographical distribution of Meliola species. Species delineation in Meliola is usually based host plant species names. However, how far naming of fungal species after host nomenclature is still questionable, as many morphologically similar Meliola species have been recorded from unrelated host plants. The range of host plants colonized by these species is highly variable with some species specialized to particular plant species. We conducted a comprehensive survey of Meliola species using published articles, books, and web-based resources. The highest species diversity was observed in tropical and sub-tropical environments. Current study focuses on the variability and geographical distribution of the genus Meliola. Meliola species have been recorded from different countries with different host plants.

Straw return increased soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), and available potassium (AK), but decreased ammonium (NH4+-N). Bacterial diversity increased at moderate N rates but decreased at higher N rates. Fungal diversity was generally higher under straw removal, with Chaetomiaceae increasing under straw return, whereas Mortierellaceae and Trichocomaceae declined at high N levels. The Mantel test showed a strong correlation between soil pH and bacterial diversity, while fungal composition was influenced by SOC, TN, and NO3\u2212-N.

A an\u00e1lise evidencia que, apesar da exist\u00eancia do poder constituinte decorrente, sua efetividade tem sido reduzida por interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es r\u00edgidas que refor\u00e7am a homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o normativa no Brasil. O estudo questiona se a rigidez interpretativa do STF compromete a diversidade normativa essencial ao federalismo, restringindo a experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00f3prias pelos entes estaduais. Diante desse cen\u00e1rio, prop\u00f5e-se uma reflex\u00e3o sobre a necessidade de uma revis\u00e3o da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da simetria, de modo que os Estados possam exercer seu poder constituinte com maior autonomia. Conclui-se que o fortalecimento do poder constituinte decorrente, aliado a uma abordagem mais flex\u00edvel da simetria, pode ampliar o pluralismo institucional e promover um federalismo mais din\u00e2mico e responsivo \u00e0s realidades locais, garantindo maior equil\u00edbrio entre unidade e diversidade no sistema constitucional brasileiro.", "venue": "Contribuciones a las ciencias sociales", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347095890", "name": "Helder Felipe Oliveira Correia"}]}, {"paperId": "8ad9804bc57a5853e429a25b92dd357ccbd6e647", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.31407/ijees15.122", "CorpusId": 276701912}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ad9804bc57a5853e429a25b92dd357ccbd6e647", "title": "AN INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR MINIMIZING DEFICIENCIES IN FUSARIUM DETECTION AT WHEAT GRAINS", "abstract": null, "venue": "International Journal of Ecosystems and Ecology Science (IJEES)", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "87166223", "name": "A.

Initially, sawdusts were enriched equally with wheat bran (WB) and at the first soaking, Lithovit\u00ae-Amino25 was applied at 5 g/L. Treatments were: T1: OS-WB (control), T2: OS-WB+ nano-amino, T3: MS-WB, T4: MS-WB+ nano-amino, T5: AS-WB, and T6: AS-WB+ nano-amino. Among non-supplemented substrates, complete mycelia run, fruiting, and harvest dates were faster in T1 than in T3 and T5. Complete mycelial development was delayed by 7, 5, 9, and 6 d in T3, T4, T5, and T6 compared to T1. The harvest date was delayed by 7.7\u20138.3 d on maple sawdust and by 10.5\u201312.7 d on apple sawdust compared to oak sawdust.

The biological yield of the second harvest was higher on supplemented than on non-supplemented maple and apple sawdusts. Only T1 and T2 showed consistency in production over two consecutive harvests. Nano-supplementation improved the total biological yield in T2, T4, and T6 by 9.8, 21.0, and 22.5%, respectively. Nevertheless, all treatments, except T4, had lower biological efficiencies compared with T1. In T4, results of stepwise regression showed a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.96) between the total biological yield and mushroom weight at the second harvest. Supplementation caused a slight or significant improvement in pileus diameter and mushroom firmness and a significant improvement in mushroom\u2019s crude protein (by 2.9\u20138.2% compared to T1) and fiber contents (by 1\u20132.3% compared to T1).

Disease symptom severity data from Fusarium ear rot (FER) on maize (Zea mays L.) is used to demonstrate the use of both genomes in genomic selection models for breeding and the identification of loci that interact across organisms to impact FER disease development. Dual genome prediction models improved heritability estimates, error variances, and model accuracy while providing predictions for host\u2010by\u2010pathogen interactions that may be used to test the significance of SNP\u2013SNP interactions. Independent GWAS for maize and Fusarium populations identified significantly associated loci and predictions that were used to evaluate the importance of interactions using two different association tests. Predictions from dual genome models were used to evaluate the significance of the SNP\u2013SNP interactions that may be associated with population structure or polygenic effects.

The fungal mycelium envelops the roots, which hinders their water and nutrient absorption. Combined with the feeding activity of the insects, this results in chlorosis, defoliation, and even plant death. Despite the significance of these interactions, they remain under-studied. To investigate the relationship between sporocarps found at the base of coffee trees, the cysts covering their roots, and the mealybug insects within them, samples of these three organisms\u2014sporocarps, cysts, and mealybugs\u2014were collected from 27 coffee plants across three farms in the departments of Norte de Santander and Quind\u00edo, Colombia. Fungi and cysts were identified by sequencing a nuclear gene region of the 28S large ribosomal subunit (28S rDNA) using the primers LSU200-F and LSU481-R. Fungal identification was further confirmed through classical taxonomy. Mealybugs were identified by sequencing a region of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) with CIF-CIR primers, corroborated through classical taxonomy. This study identified four fungal species associated with four species of Pseudococcidae. The fungus Phlebopus beniensis was associated with the mealybugs Pseudococcus elisae, Dysmicoccus neobrevipes, D. brevipes, and Pseudococcus nr. sociabilis. Phlebopus portentosus was linked to D. neobrevipes, while Xerophorus olivascens and Boletinellus rompelii were associated with other Pseudococcidae species. Additionally, the fungus Pseudolaccaria pachyphylla was found in coffee plants harboring mealybugs.

Although antifungal agents are often used concomitantly with cyclosporine, the effect of switching from voriconazole to isavuconazole on the blood cyclosporine level remains unclear.A 63-year-old Japanese male was administered oral cyclosporine (10:00 and 21:00) for severe aplastic anemia. Following pneumonia with positive Aspergillus antigen and an elevated \u03b2-D-glucan level, antifungal therapy was initiated. After switching from voriconazole (10:00 and 21:00) to isavuconazole (approximately 08:00), the blood cyclosporine level decreased by more than half. Although the blood cyclosporine level decreased after switching to isavuconazole, the dose of cyclosporine was not increased because of its possible effect on renal function. Considering the inhibitory effects on the gastrointestinal tract, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic analysis estimated that isavuconazole increased the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of cyclosporine by 1.48-fold and 1.84-fold, respectively, although assuming no change in gastrointestinal metabolism, these effects were minimal.

The common resistance to current treatments underscores the urgency to explore alternative therapeutic strategies, including drug repurposing.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the potential of repurposing tafenoquine, an antimalarial agent, for antifungal use against C. haemulonii sensu stricto.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe efficacy of tafenoquine was tested using in vitro assays for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum fungicidal concentration, biofilm inhibition, cell damage, cell membrane integrity, nucleotide leakage, sorbitol protection assay, and efflux pump inhibition. The compound's cytotoxicity was assessed through a haemolysis assay, and in vivo safety and efficacy were tested using Tenebrio molitor larvae.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTafenoquine exhibited potent fungicidal activity against C. haemulonii sensu stricto with an MIC of 4\u2005mg/L and significantly inhibited biofilm formation by 60.63%. Tafenoquine also impaired mitochondrial functionality, leading to compromised cellular respiration. Despite these effects, tafenoquine did not cause significant protein leakage, indicating a distinct mechanism from membrane-targeting agents.

We examined a total of eight fluorescent protein coding genes, out of which three were found to be applicable for simultaneous utilisation. We investigated three clinical isolates of C. parapsilosis in terms of their adherence to silicone and their uptake by J774.2 murine macrophages in competition assays. Interestingly, we found significant differences between them in both experiments where GA1 isolate was significantly less resistant to macrophage uptake and CDC317 was significantly more adherent to silicone material. In silico analysis of the agglutinin-like sequences (Als) exposed remarkable diversity in this protein family and additionally, the thorough analysis of the ALS genes revealed evidence of formation of a new gene by intrachromosomal recombination in the GA1 isolate.

Gene expression regulation is largely encoded in the promoter of the gene, which harbors numerous transcription factor binding sites. In the mating MAPK pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one major transcription factor, Ste12, controls the chronology of gene expression necessary for the fusion of two haploid cells. Because endogenous promoters encode a large diversity of Ste12 binding sites (PRE), we engineered synthetic promoters to decipher the rules that dictate mating gene induction. Conformations of PRE dimers that allow efficient gene expression were identified. The strength of binding of Ste12 to the PRE and the distance of the binding sites to the core promoter modulate the level of induction. The speed of activation is ensured by favoring a basal association of Ste12 by using a strong dimer of PRE located in a nucleosome depleted region. Author Summary During development, cell fate decisions allow pluripotent cells to differentiate into various cell types. This process requires cells to integrate signals from their surroundings to initiate a complex transcriptional program. Budding yeasts can also undergo cell fate decisions. In presence of mating pheromones, haploid yeasts can activate a signaling pathway which can ultimately lead to the fusion of two haploid cells to form a diploid. One transcription factor, Ste12, controls this mating transcriptional program. The promoters of these 200 upregulated genes display a large diversity in the organization of Ste12 binding sites. Therefore, it is challenging to decipher how Ste12 regulates the level and the timing of gene expression. To simplify this problem, we have generated synthetic promoters, where the configuration of Ste12 binding sites on the DNA can be controlled. We have identified which conformations of binding site dimers allow a functional association of the transcription factor. In addition, we have also shown that the basal association of Ste12 to the promoter is important for the fast gene induction. An unfavorable configuration of Ste12 binding sites or the presence of nucleosomes restrict the access of the transcription factor to the DNA and results in a slower expression.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/03/27/2024.03.26.586726.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-23", "authors": [{"authorId": "2144049429", "name": "Sandrine Pinheiro"}, {"authorId": "1398669362", "name": "Mariona Nadal-Ribelles"}, {"authorId": "50647950", "name": "Carme Sol\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "2248786174", "name": "Vincent Vincenzetti"}, {"authorId": "2248789428", "name": "Yves Dusserre"}, {"authorId": "2347046569", "name": "Francesc Posas"}, {"authorId": "3058692", "name": "Serge Pelet"}]}, {"paperId": "cca8010c01c187ad8a43ea62e1bb1b02eb71b59e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1002/jbio.202400556", "CorpusId": 276568014, "PubMed": "39988476"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cca8010c01c187ad8a43ea62e1bb1b02eb71b59e", "title": "Scattering Reduction and Axial Resolution Enhancement in\u00a0Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy.", "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides an ideal tool for long-term observation of live specimens due to its low photodamage and fast volumetric imaging speed.

In line with identified recovery objectives of re-establishing populations within the species' former range, a founder population was translocated to a feral predator-free fenced exclosure within previously occupied habitat to the south of its current range. No published reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemistry exist for this species. Establishing reference intervals provides a valuable tool for health assessment of founder animals and investigations into population health and disease during ongoing monitoring of populations.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo develop reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemistry parameters in northern bettongs, Bettongia tropica.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHaematological and serum biochemical reference intervals were determined from 39 healthy northern bettongs captured across the Lamb Range region of north Queensland. Routine haematological and biochemical parameters were analysed, including blood gases and lactate, which indicate metabolic changes associated with stress.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHaematological and serum biochemical parameters were similar to those reported from other potoroids, except for haematocrit and serum protein, which were elevated. Stress parameters were within normal limits. Macropod herpesvirus and Toxoplasma gondii were not detected.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTranslocated northern bettongs were in good general health, and data collected at the time of capture were sufficient to establish a preliminary reference interval for the species.

In this study, we presented a rapid and effective site-directed mutagenesis strategy using one-step multi-mismatch PCR, termed Yeast Genome Mutagenesis with Multi-mismatch PCR (YGMMP). YGMMP incorporated multiple synonymous mutations proximal to the target point mutations, along with a selection marker cassette and flanking homologous sequences, into the gene segment spanning from the desired mutation to the gene's terminus through overlap PCR. The resulting PCR product was introduced into yeast cells to facilitate the selection of target variants. As a proof of concept, we applied YGMMP to generate an ADE2 mutant. The results demonstrated that the introduction of five and nine synonymous mutations, in addition to the desired single-point mutation, yielded mutagenesis efficiencies of approximately 20% and 30%, respectively.

This study is aimed at assessing the efficacy of pre-sowing seed treatments with cold atmospheric plasma for the disinfestation of winter wheat seed from economically important fungal and fungal-like pathogens. Uninoculated or surface-inoculated with Fusarium culmorum, Bipolaris sorokiniana or Pythium ultimum wheat seeds, the cultivar Madara was treated by cold plasma produced either by microwave torch (MW) or underwater diaphragm discharge (UW) with low power at very short treatment times, or remained untreated controls. As per the treatments, the seeds were sown in a ready-to-use growing medium comprising a mixture of light and dark moss peat (w:w) 90\u201395%, 5\u201310% perlite and 3\u20135 kg/m3 CaCO3, having an electrical conductivity of 40 mS/m, pH (H2O) of 5.5\u20136.5 and moisture content of 60\u201370%, filling in 250 \u00d7 250 \u00d7 70 mm aluminum flat seed trays (40 grains per tray, four trays per treatment). The plants were cultivated for 45 days in a growth chamber held at (20 \u00b1 2) \u00b0C, set to a cycle of 8 h/night and 16 h/day under fluorescent light of 2000\u20133000 lux intensity. For each replicate, disease incidence (DI) was determined as the total percentage of missing, dead and apparently symptomatic plants. Seed treatment with a microwave plasma torch with a power of 16 W for 40 s significantly (p < 0.001) reduced seedling blights caused by F. culmorum, B. sorokiniana and P. ultimum by 46.8%, 51.0% and 77.3%, respectively, but limited the emergence of wheat seedlings by 15.9% on average. Simultaneously, the effectiveness of underwater discharge seed treatments reached an average of about a 60% reduction of seedling blight caused by F. culmorum and B. sorokiniana and about 37% of the disease caused by P. ultimum. Pre-sowing treatments with a MW plasma torch with an input power of 11 W and treatment time of 60, 90 or 120 s exposure also showed significant (p < 0.001) effects in controlling winter wheat seedling blights caused by the three pathogens. The effectiveness of the treatment increased with increasing the time period of exposure and reached full disease control (>80% reduction) for B. sorokiniana and P. ultimum seedling blights. This study demonstrated that pre-sowing treatment with a microwave plasma torch and underwater diaphragm discharge at a relatively low input power and short exposure time can be used for disinfestation and the effective control of seedling blights in winter wheat caused by seed-borne fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium culmorum and Bipolaris sorokiniana, and fungal-like oomycetes, such as Pythium ultimum.", "venue": "Processes", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-23", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347113497", "name": "Tzenko Vatchev"}, {"authorId": "90943621", "name": "I.

UA was directly mixed with potato dextrose agar and broth media to assay its antifungal activity in vitro. The results showed that UA exerted inherent antifungal activity and directly inhibited the in vitro growth and spore germination of Penicillium expansum. Its half-maximal inhibitory concentration for hyphal growth was 175.6 mg L\u22121. Apple fruit were immersed in UA solution, followed by inoculation with P. expansum, to measure their disease response. The results demonstrated that UA induced significant disease resistance in apple fruit and that its mechanisms are multifaceted and associated with defensive and antioxidative enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Chitinase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase were activated and maintained at relatively high levels. The activities of enzymes and their metabolites in the phenylpropanoid pathway, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase were significantly increased; accordingly, total phenolics, flavonoid, and lignin contents were significantly increased. The activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were enhanced upon UA treatment, while catalase activity was suppressed, which regulates hydrogen peroxide accumulation to defend against pathogens.

The convenience and pervasiveness of these come at a high cost with adverse effects on human health and our planet\u2019s ecosystems as they are not biodegradable. It is pivotal that an alternative and sustainable solution is found to address this problem. Mycelium-based biocomposites, made up of root-like networks called hyphae are sought out as a potential substitute for plastic-based foams as they are biodegradable. They employ a waste-to-value strategy by using agricultural wastes as a growing media for the mycelium. The study primarily focuses on the comparative analysis of mycelium-based biocomposites with existing foam materials such as Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS) and evaluates their efficacy as a biodegradable packaging material. Thus, we plan to identify the efficacious strain of mycelium from Pleurotus ostreatus or Ganoderma lucidum and also explore various substrate materials such as cocopith, cardboard, paper, and sawdust. Our preliminary compression results show that the biocomposites can be engineered to have Young\u2019s modulus ranging from 1-3 MPa for both strains.

The objective was to characterize morphologically, molecularly and biochemically the fungus associated with LS in BGD coconut palm and evaluate its susceptibility to commercial biological fungicides. Materials and methods. The isolate was characterized morphologically and molecularly. Their growth, sporulation and laccase production were evaluated using different culture media. The in vitro mycelial inhibition and mean lethal doses (LD50) of commercial biological fungicides based on antagonistic fungi (Trichoderma harzianum and T. viride), bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens) and actinobacteria (Streptomyces lydicus and S. jofer) were determined. Results. Bipolaris oryzae was the associated agent of LS, it produces 25.54 and 22.17 U mg of protein-1 of laccase activity in the Sivakumar and wheat bran (WB) media. The WB medium allowed the greatest sporulation. Trichoderma harzianum inhibited B. oryzae at 100% in the four evaluated doses.

Mushrooms provide a distinguishable taste and aroma and are an essential source of vitamin D2, vitamin B complex, hydroxybenzoic acids (HBAs) and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), terpenes, sterols, and \u03b2-glucans. Edible mushroom varieties such as Hericium erinaceus, Ganoderma sp., and Lentinula edodes are recognized as functional foods due to their remarkable potential for disease prevention and promotion of overall health and well-being. These varieties have antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, cholesterol-lowering, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties, as well as controlling blood pressure, being an immunity booster, and strengthening bone properties. In addition, they contain essential non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs) and ergothioneine, a potential substrate for gut microflora. Supplementing our daily meals with those can add value to our food, providing health benefits. Novel edible mushrooms are being investigated to explore their bioactive substances and their therapeutic properties, to benefit human health.

One of the primary sources of CyA production is its biosynthesis by the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum; however, low production yield remains a significant challenge. Objectives: This research aimed to study the impact of UV radiation-induced random mutations on CyA production and fermentation broth viscosity in the strain T. inflatum PTCC 5253. Methods: To determine the baseline CyA production in T. inflatum PTCC 5253, the supernatant of a 14-day fermented original strain in semi synthetic medium (SSM), as well as standard concentrations of CyA, were evaluated for bioactivity against Aspergillus niger. The strain was then subjected to 254 nm UV irradiation at various durations, including 140 s, 160 s, 180 s, 200 s, and 220 s. The resulting mutants were fermented in SSM for 14 days, and their ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts were screened by LC/MS analysis for CyA detection. Additionally, the rheological parameters of the fermented media, including shear stress and viscosity, were determined. Results: The CyA production in T. inflatum PTCC 5253 was measured at 34.04 mg/L based on bioactivity evaluation and 37.5 mg/L based on LC-MS analysis. The UV radiation resulted in 20 revived mutants, 10 of which showed significantly elevated CyA yield. Notably, the isolate M4 exhibited a remarkable 14-fold increase compared to the original strain, producing 540 mg CyA/L of medium. Furthermore, increased CyA production in the selected mutants correlated with an elevation in medium viscosity, and the media exhibited shear-thinning behavior. Conclusions: In conclusion, random mutation induced by UV radiation can significantly enhance CyA productivity in T. inflatum PTCC 5253. Additionally, our results suggest a crucial correlation between CyA production and fermentation media viscosity.", "venue": "Journal of Reports in Pharmaceutical Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348280322", "name": "Masoud Abdoli"}, {"authorId": "2348280144", "name": "Alireza Tavakkoli"}, {"authorId": "2291997198", "name": "Mohammad Reza Bakhtiari"}, {"authorId": "2348273998", "name": "Abolghasem Danesh"}]}, {"paperId": "dd01bdd111a430a4a2caa682f7a717ce2482da40", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "11846725", "DOI": "10.1007/s00128-024-03986-8", "CorpusId": 276556590, "PubMed": "39987283"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd01bdd111a430a4a2caa682f7a717ce2482da40", "title": "Screening and Characteristics of Cadmium-Tolerant Microorganisms in Soil Remediation", "abstract": null, "venue": "Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2297132469", "name": "Lei Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2310189489", "name": "Luxuan Feng"}, {"authorId": "2310212028", "name": "Xiaofeng Chen"}, {"authorId": "51119612", "name": "Jinghua Yao"}, {"authorId": "2346893779", "name": "Yunyun Li"}, {"authorId": "2290025243", "name": "Xiujuan Feng"}]}, {"paperId": "dc6eacb820ea1d62fd44d355ff0711c60f5ae6d5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/jof11030176", "CorpusId": 276587763}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc6eacb820ea1d62fd44d355ff0711c60f5ae6d5", "title": "Mr-lac3 and Mr-lcc2 in Metarhizium robertsii Regulate Conidiation and Maturation, Enhancing Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses and Pathogenicity", "abstract": "As a type of multicopper oxidase, laccases play multiple biological roles in entomopathogenic fungi, enhancing their survival, development, and pathogenicity.

Although TKC is considered a potential gene introduction tool, donor chromosomal genes that influence TKC efficiency have rarely been analyzed, hindering targeted donor breeding. To identify potential TKC-related genes on a donor chromosome, a genome-wide screening of TKC-deficient mutants was performed using a comprehensive collection of Escherichia coli gene knockout mutants (Keio collection) as donors and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as a recipient. Out of 3884 mutants, two mutants (\u2206aceE, \u2206priA) showed a severe decrease in TKC efficiency by more than two orders of magnitude but not in bacterial conjugation. The effect on TKC efficiency by the two mutants was partly recovered by a preculture with a fresh culture medium before the TKC reaction, regardless of the presence of antibiotics.

The goal was to identify how different promoters affect the fermentation performance of laboratory and industrial yeast strains under various media conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nFour constitutive promoters-TEF1p, ADH1p, PGK1p, and TDH3p-were tested to overexpress XKS1 in two strains of S. cerevisiae, one laboratory strain (BY4742) and one industrial strain (PE-2B), both engineered with a heterologous xylose isomerase pathway. The strains were evaluated in defined (YNB) and complex (YPDX) media, as well as a synthetic sugarcane hydrolysate, over a 144-hour fermentation period. Promoter choice significantly influenced cell growth, xylose consumption and ethanol production. In the laboratory strain, TEF1p yielded the highest ethanol production in YPDX, while TDH3p promoted higher biomass formation. In the industrial strain, ADH1p, TEF1p, and PGK1p led to high ethanol yields in YPDX, with ADH1p showing superior performance in the synthetic hydrolysate.

All plates were incubated in a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) chamber at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00baC with a photoperiod of 12 h for seven days. Plants were inoculated by spraying the fourth, fifth, and sixth fully expanded leaves with a suspension of T. harzianum UFT-25 conidia. Control plants received an application of autoclaved distilled water containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. Analysis of the results revealed a significant difference between the treatments in terms of height, diameter, leaf and branch numbers, dry mass, and chlorophyll. T. harzianum UFT-25 stimulated greater growth in the inoculated plants than control plants at 15, 30, 45, and 60 d. The inoculated plants have been shown an increase of 16.19% in the shoot dry mass and 51.65% in the root dry mass. These results open new avenues for exploring the potential of T. harzianum UFT-25, proving its efficiency in promoting the growth of Eucalyptus plants. Thus, the use of this fungus can contribute to the reduction of inputs, such as fungicides and fertilizers, promoting greater sustainability in forestry production.", "venue": "Research, Society and Development", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2269641924", "name": "L.

However, whether and how C. elegans interacts with co-occurring fungi remains largely unknown, despite the presence of many fungal species in its natural habitat. Here, we isolate the yeast Barnettozyma californica from a mesocosm experiment with C. elegans and characterize its genome and interaction with the nematode. We find that B. californica is ingested by C. elegans and can serve as a sole, albeit poor, food source. Yet, when present together with Escherichia coli OP50, the fungus can lead to higher population growth and altered foraging behavior, suggesting that this fungi-bacteria mixture provides a better food source than bacteria alone. This effect varied between different natural C. elegans strains, suggesting a genomic basis for the nematode\u2019s interaction with B. californica. The fully assembled and annotated genome of the isolated B. californica strain does not indicate any obvious candidate genes for its interaction with C. elegans and/or E. coli OP50. Overall, our results provide an intriguing example of the complexity and multi-level relationship between naturally interacting fungi, bacteria, and animals. Graphical Abstract Barnettozyma californica is a member of the fungal microbiome of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and can serve as food for worms.

In the meat production chain, their application has gained attention due to the increasing demand for enhanced food safety, quality assurance, food fraud detection, and regulatory compliance. Biosensors can detect foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli/STEC, L. monocytogenes, etc.), spoilage bacteria and indicators, contaminants (pesticides, dioxins, and mycotoxins), antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes, hormones (growth promoters and stress hormones), and metabolites (acute-phase proteins as inflammation markers) at different modules along the meat chain, from livestock farming to packaging in the farm-to-fork (F2F) continuum. By providing real-time data from the meat chain, biosensors enable early interventions, reducing the health risks (foodborne outbreaks) associated with contaminated meat/meat products or sub-standard meat products. Recent advancements in micro- and nanotechnology, microfluidics, and wireless communication have further enhanced the sensitivity, specificity, portability, and automation of biosensors, making them suitable for on-site field applications. The integration of biosensors with blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) systems allows for acquired data integration and management, while their integration with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enables rapid data processing, analytics, and input for risk assessment by competent authorities. This promotes transparency and traceability within the meat chain, fostering consumer trust and industry accountability. Despite biosensors\u2019 promising potential, challenges such as scalability, reliability associated with the complexity of meat matrices, and regulatory approval are still the main challenges.

We compared the emergence and biomass produced from Pseudoroegneria spicata seed that was uncoated, coated with no active ingredient, and fungicide-coated, across five soil treatments promoting different levels of fungal biomass. For uncoated seed, both percent emergence and total biomass of seedlings were highest in autoclaved soil and declined when fungi were present, but the level of fungus did not impact emergence or biomass for fungicide-coated seed.

Many bioactive extracts from Pleurotus species have been found to exhibit antitumor and antioxidant activities. However, to grow oyster mushrooms in this study, the pasteurized Cenchrus fungigraminus was used as culture material, a type of grass that proliferates and has a high root growth rate. It contains high levels of sugar and protein and yields a large amount of biomass. Because of these characteristics, it is considered an efficient and cost-effective energy crop with various applications, including phytoremediation and fodder production. A pasteurization technique for this grass that is suited for the simplest formulation is simple and cost-effective for growing oyster mushrooms on small farms. This study used pasteurized Cenchrus fungigraminus as a substrate to grow three mushroom species: Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius and Pleurotus florida. The aim was to evaluate their enzyme activities, growth rate, and yields. The findings demonstrated that the average growth rate of three species grown in pasteurized C.\u00a0fungigraminus was between 25 days and 36 days. Therefore, the mycelium growth rate of P. ostreatus was faster than other pleurotus species in this study. The highest biological efficiency was recorded with P. ostreatus at 78.23%, then P. pulmonarius at 59.88, and lastly, 39.66% P. florida. The changes in five enzyme activities in distinct developmental stages of three different pleurotus species were evaluated. Therefore, the laccase had the highest peak with 13.8 U/g on the 20th day during the growth phase and gradually decreased to the fruiting body stage of P. ostreatus. The expression of manganese peroxidase reached the highest activity of 3.6 U/g in P. ostreatus compared to P. florida and P. pulmonarius on the 10th day.

The presence of aflatoxins in staple foods poses significant health risks, including hepatocarcinogenic effects, and has economic implications for food security. Pre-harvest and post-harvest practices can be applied to prevent or minimize aflatoxin levels in food, such as Crop protection, drying of cereals, sorting moldy or damaged Kernels, storing food in a dry place, use of fungicides and even use of gamma rays to radiate crops.\u00a0", "venue": "European Journal of Nutrition &amp; Food Safety", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346854496", "name": "Kemoi E.K."}, {"authorId": "2346879841", "name": "F.O.

These persistent compounds often escape removal in conventional wastewater treatment processes, leading to environmental contamination and human exposure. Given their widespread presence in wastewater and resistance to conventional treatments, the use of fungi offers a promising bioremediation strategy. This review explores the potential of fungal biodegradation, particularly using the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor, in mitigating the estrogenic activity of EDs in wastewater. Laccase, an oxidative enzyme produced by white-rot fungus, shows high efficiency in degrading EDs, positioning fungal treatment as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional technologies.

Giardia lamblia does not encode proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn12 or proteasome complex subunit Sem1, two proteins crucial for assembling the proteasome lid. To understand how the interactions between the giardial proteasome lid subunits may have changed to compensate for their absence, we used yeast two-hybrid to generate a binary interactome map of Giardia's lid subunits. Most interactions within the Giardia lid are stronger than Saccharomyces cerevisiae lid, which may compensate for Rpn12 and Sem1 absence. A notable exception was the weaker interaction between the two non-ATPase lid subunits, GlRpn11 and GlRpn8, compared to the strong interaction between yeast orthologs Rpn11 and Rpn8. The Rpn11-Rpn8 dimer provides a platform for lid assembly. Their interaction involves the insertion of a methionine residue of Rpn11 into a hydrophobic pocket of Rpn8. Molecular modeling indicates that GlRpn8's pocket is wider, reconciling the experimental observation of its weak interaction with GlRpn11. This weaker interaction may have evolved to support proteasome-independent functions of GlRpn11, which localizes to multiple subcellular regions, including the mitosomes, where other proteasome subunits cannot be detected. Functional complementation in yeast shows that GlRpn11 can influence mitochondrial function and distribution. Together these observations show that GlRpn11 functions at the mitosome. Thus, this parasite's proteasome lid has a simpler subunit architecture than that of yeast with structural attributes to support dual functionalities for GlRpn11. Such parasite-specific proteasome features provide opportunities for controlling parasite transmission.", "venue": "The FEBS Journal", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2322459139", "name": "Ankita Das"}, {"authorId": "40439411", "name": "Atrayee Ray"}, {"authorId": "2190519577", "name": "Nibedita Ray Chaudhuri"}, {"authorId": "2153292905", "name": "Soumyajit Mukherjee"}, {"authorId": "52146133", "name": "Shubhra Ghosh Dastidar"}, {"authorId": "2250721933", "name": "Alok Ghosh"}, {"authorId": "2316632947", "name": "Sandipan Ganguly"}, {"authorId": "2316632315", "name": "Kuladip Jana"}, {"authorId": "5038445", "name": "Srimonti Sarkar"}]}, {"paperId": "638ca1e8f4c59e88482507d58047fa83c4ee24d6", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2025.02.17.638669", "CorpusId": 276581200}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/638ca1e8f4c59e88482507d58047fa83c4ee24d6", "title": "Agricultural land use induces broader homogenization of soil microbial functional composition than taxonomic composition", "abstract": "Land-use changes from natural ecosystems to farmlands significantly alter soil functioning worldwide, especially challenging sub-Saharan Africa with rapid population growth and intensive agriculture. Soil microbial diversity is vital in supporting ecosystem multifunctionality and preventing pathogen growth. Recent studies have revealed that farming activities homogenize microbial communities across distant sites, which may lead to functional homogenization on that scale. However, given the redundancy of microbial functions, functional homogenization driven by farming may occur on a broader scale than taxonomic homogenization. We compared the taxonomic and functional compositions of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities between natural lands and farmlands at scales ranging from within-site (\u223c200 m) to across-site (\u223c1500 km) in Kenya and Malawi, using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS genes and the prediction of microbial functions. Soil microbial functional compositions were homogenized more broadly than taxonomic compositions in farmlands compared to natural lands, suggesting that similar functional responses to farming occur across scales where different taxa thrive. Furthermore, environmental factors predominantly influenced within-site homogeneity, whereas farming itself was a significant contributor to across-site homogeneity, indicating an overriding influence of farming compared to environmental variations. Additionally, pathogenic fungi were relatively more abundant in farmlands, likely due to reduced species competition and farming-induced environmental changes such as low soil pH. Our findings highlight the need to investigate microbial functional diversity alongside taxonomic diversity when assessing the impacts of land-use changes on soil health to develop sustainable land management strategies.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2139148012", "name": "Takamitsu Ohigashi"}, {"authorId": "107737165", "name": "Y.

Transcriptional reprogramming highlighted the upregulation of genes in the roots involved in mineral homeostasis (Ferritin 1, Iron dehydrogenase, Nitrate transporter 1), hormone signaling (Ethylene-insensitive protein 3, Gibberellin 2-oxidase), and osmotic regulation (Aquaporin, Dehydrin), underlining key adaptive responses to maintain nutrient uptake, redox status, and cellular turgor. In Fe-supplemented plants, increased Fe in roots correlated with increased Ferritin 1 expression, improved plant health, and reduced Fenton reaction rate and H O levels. This suggests that ferritin helps minimize oxidative stress under drought in sorghum. Drought reduced root-associated bacterial diversity and richness while enriching drought tolerance-associated genera, such as Burkholderia, Caballeronia and Paraburkholderia, known for promoting plant growth through auxin production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore-mediated iron acquisition. In contrast, fungal diversity and richness remained unchanged, dominated by Talaromyces, which showed a statistically non-significant increase under drought. Random forest models could not identify functional predictors for fungi but revealed a shift in bacterial functional groups under drought, with enrichment in phototrophy, methylotrophy, and nitrate reduction, traits emphasizing microbial roles in nutrient cycling and drought adaptation of sorghum. This study provides insights into the role of ferritin and potential bacterial bioinoculants that could enhance sorghum resilience to drought. Future research should validate these findings to integrate them into breeding programs and biofertilizer formulation for drought-tolerant sorghum and climate-resilient agriculture.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/07/25/2024.07.19.604343.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2266634861", "name": "Ahmad H.

However, one of the challenges of using TWW as an irrigation source is the accumulation of non-essential toxic elements in soil post-irrigation. Thus, this study determined whether indigenous microbes that are tolerant to toxic elements would remediate non-essential toxic elements in contaminated soil following irrigation with TWW. Soil from a fallowed field at the University of Limpopo Experimental Farm was irrigated with TWW in pots for 12 weeks. After that, an incubation study was established to assess the abilities of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to remediate the contaminated soil over 12 weeks. Both water and soil samples (non-contaminated, contaminated, and remediated) were analysed for toxic elements: Aluminium (Al), Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd), and Lead (Pb). Data were analysed using GenStat 20th edition. The results revealed that irrigation with TWW increased the concentration of non-essential toxic elements in soil by 110%, 31%, 31%, 31%, and 54% for Al, As, Cr, Cd, and Pb, respectively. The inoculation of soil with indigenous microbes led to the decline in the concentration of non-essential toxic elements in soil. Furthermore, soils inoculated with S. aureus led to a reduction in Cr to levels below those observed prior to irrigation with TWW. Overall, the findings of the study effectively convey that these indigenous microbes can be used for bioremediation.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-21", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346741425", "name": "Itumeleng Kgobokanang Jacob Kekana"}, {"authorId": "82115507", "name": "P.

In metazoans, its emergence may have been driven by a development-defense trade-off associated with transposable element activation during the evolution of multicellularity. Late Devonian cooling and End-Permian warming are hypothesized to have driven the emergence of extensive A-to-I recoding in coleoid nervous systems and Sordariomycete sexual fruiting bodies, respectively. These adaptations may have influenced key evolutionary innovations, including the evolution of metazoan nervous systems, coleoid intelligence, and shell loss, and fungal sexual reproductive structures.

Under endoscopy, the esophageal mucosa shows edema, congestion, erosion, and ulceration, and bleeds easily when touched, and the surface of the mucosa is covered with small white spots like \"bean curd residue\". Clinical cases showing typical FE under endoscopic imaging but negative esophageal mucosal brush (referred to as suspected FE) have increased the difficulty and challenge of clinical diagnosis and treatment. At present, the esophageal fungal flora of suspected case has not been thoroughly studied. AIM To characterize the fungal flora in FE, suspected FE, and the esophageal normal controls (NCs), and to identify marker species to improve detection of FE. METHODS This was a case-control study. A total of 19 patients with FE, 16 with suspected FE, and 10 NCs were selected by endoscopy. The esophageal cell brush samples of each group were sequenced by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and analyzed by bioinformatics. RESULTS In FE and suspected FE patients, species richness, species diversity and species evenness, as measured by the Chao1 index, Shannon index and Pielou index, were lower than in the NCs, and the comparison between the FE and NCs was the most significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the NCs, the relative abundance of Candida in FE and suspected FE patients was significantly increased (P < 0.001), while the relative abundance of Yarrowia was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Moreover, Yarrowia abundance in the FE group was significantly lower than in the NCs and suspected FE groups (P < 0.001). The area under the curve for Candida in FE and suspected FE patients was 99.5% (P < 0.05) and 81.3% (P < 0.05), respectively. Finally, compared with FE patients, the relative abundance of Ascomycota and Candida in the esophageal flora of suspected FE patients was decreased, while the relative abundance of Yarrowia, Thermomyces and Pichia was increased. CONCLUSION ITS showed that composition of the fungal community was similar in the FE and suspected FE groups.

The study included 663 patients with SCAP. The density of HAIs in patients with SCAP was 6.2/1000 days of device use (DDU) and shows an increase in the period 2021\u20132023. The frequency of CLABSI caused by multiple drug resistance (MDR) pathogens was 69.2%, CAUTI 24.4%, VAP 42.9%. 72 cases of HAI were registered in 67 patients, of which 24 (35,8%) patients with SCAP had 50 critical and high priority pathogens, of which 16 (23.8%) had bacterial-fungal associations. The priority pathogens in the registration of DAIs for the entire analyzed period were carbapenem-resistant strains of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae as well as K. pneumoniae isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. A trend towards expanding the spectrum of pathogens and increasing the proportion of Candida non-albicans in the etiological structure of fungal HAIs was identified in the period 2021\u20132023. Independent predictors of DAIs were identified in patients with SCAP, which were > 7 DDU for CLABSI, and > 72 hours of mechanical ventilation for VAP, and an increase in procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/ml for VAP and CAUTI. When registering CAUTI, the severity of comorbidities (CCI score \u2265 5: 3.829; 1.867\u20137.852, p < 0.001) in patients with SCAP and the severity of organ dysfunction (SOFA score > 4.0 (9.976; 1.277\u201377.958, p = 0.028) in patients with SCAP COVID-19 were independent predictors of HAIs.Conclusion.

However, the mycobiome characteristics in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and its correlation with recurrence have not yet been investigated. The mycobiome in 80 LSCC samples was characterized using internal transcribed spacer sequencing, encompassing both tumor tissues and their matched para-cancerous tissues. The intratumoral bacteriome was further identified using 16S rRNA sequencing. These two microbial communities were analyzed using bioinformatics and statistical methods to determine its potential correlation with LSCC recurrence. The fungal alpha diversity in tumors was higher compared with that in para-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). A significant difference in the overall fungal community patterns between tumor tissues and para-cancerous tissues was observed based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (P < 0.001). The presence of Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Candida, and Fusarium in tumors exhibited a correlation with alcohol consumption. The relative abundance of Penicillium, Exophiala, and Aspergillus in the mycobiome, as well as that of Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, and Peptostreptococcus in the bacteriome significantly increased the risk of LSCC recurrence (P < 0.05). These six microorganisms can combine to form a microbial complex, which may independently contribute to recurrence risk in patients with LSCC when enriched within the tumor (hazard ratio = 6.844, P < 0.01). Intratumoral fungi and bacteria can be valuable indicators for assessing recurrence in patients with LSCC, indicating their potential as valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nOur results revealed that dysbiosis of intratumoral microbiota, including increased fungal community diversity and overgrowth of several fungal or bacterial organisms, is substantially linked to the recurrence of LSCC. Drinking habits might alter the laryngeal microbiota to influence the recurrence of LSCC. We also explored a method to potentially predict the recurrence of LSCC from a novel perspective. These findings could offer insights into the etiology of LSCC and pave way to prevent and treat LSCC.", "venue": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-21", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346556075", "name": "Xinhui Mao"}, {"authorId": "120738024", "name": "Hui-ying Huang"}, {"authorId": "2346514779", "name": "Limin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2170335682", "name": "Feiran Li"}, {"authorId": "2346519154", "name": "Zhenwei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2115845722", "name": "X.

Candida infections, particularly hospital-acquired ones, are a significant health threat due to their resistance to antifungals and the risk of developing systemic infections (i.e., sepsis). We have previously shown that C14R reduces the viability of C. albicans and C. auris, but not of C. parapsilosis. Here, we show that C14R not only inhibits viability by pore formation, shown in a resazurin reduction assay, and in a C. parapsilosis and fluorescence-based permeabilization assay, but it also halts biofilm maturation and significantly reduces the biomass of preformed biofilms by over 70%.

Single amino acid changes in RNA exosome subunits cause rare genetic diseases collectively called exosomopathies. However, distinguishing disease-causing variants from non-pathogenic ones remains challenging, and the mechanism by which these variants cause disease is largely unknown. Previous studies have employed a budding yeast model of RNA exosome-linked diseases that relies on mutating the orthologous yeast genes. Here, we develop a humanized yeast model of exosomopathies that allows us to unambiguously assess damaging effects of the exact patient variant in budding yeast. Individual replacement of the yeast subunits with corresponding mammalian orthologs identified six out of nine non-catalytic core subunits of the budding yeast RNA exosome that can be replaced by a mammalian subunit, with three of the replacements supporting close to normal growth. Further analysis of the disease-associated variants utilizing the hybrid yeast/mammalian RNA exosome revealed functional defects caused by both previously characterized and uncharacterized variants of EXOSC2, EXOSC4, EXOSC7, and EXOSC9. Analysis of the protein levels of these variants indicates that a subset of the patient-derived variants causes reduced protein levels, while other variants are defective but are expressed as well as the reference allele, suggesting a more direct contribution of these residues to RNA exosome function. This humanized yeast model of exosomopathies provides a convenient and sensitive genetic tool to help distinguish damaging RNA exosome variants from benign variants.

The goal of this study is to synthesis and characterization of AgNPs using leaf extract from Ipomoea aquatica and antimicrobial (Bacteria, Fungi) activity that are resistant to antibiotics that were found in medical waste from Kushtia Sadar Hospital, such as disposable syringes and needles. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was primarily confirmed by the color change (brown) of the sample solution. Additionally, characterization was performed via UV-vis spectroscopy, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) peaks showed up at 454 nm with an absorbance of 1.287 for 1:2, 461 nm with an absorbance of 1.322 for 1:4, 452 nm with an absorbance of 1.632 for 1:6, 466 nm with an absorbance of 0.943 for 1:8, 446 nm with an absorbance of 0.699 for 1:10, 448 nm with an absorbance of 0.622 for 1:12 ratios. Multiple antibiotic resistance bacteria were isolated from the medical wastages which were controlled effectively by applying synthesized nanoparticles at different doses. Bacterial Strain BSN7 is the most sensitive strain, having a 13\u00b10.208 mm inhibitory zone at a concentration of 60\u03bcg/mL of AgNPs. BSN8 and BSN9 are the most sensitive at 60\u03bcg/mL concentration of AgNPs with inhibitory zones of 11\u00b10.2 mm and 12\u00b10.153 mm respectively. Whereas at the concentration of 15\u03bcg/mL the zone of inhibition for bacterial strains BSN7, BSN8 and BSN9 are 6\u00b10.1, 7\u00b10 and 8\u00b10.058 which is considered as MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration). Eventually, it can be stated that synthesized silver may play a significant role in developing a novel therapeutic strategy to manage infections that are resistant to antibiotics.

Public health efforts to address the oral cancer burden depends largely on the available empirical evidence. Hence, this scoping review aims to map the existing empirical evidence on oral cancer in East African countries. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used as a guideline for reporting this scoping review. Additionally, we ensured quality assessment of the methodology and reporting process of this study using the AMSTAR 2 checklist. We conducted a systematic search of nine research databases on 17th November 2023, and reviewed studies published in English from year 2000 to 17th November 2023. The team developed data extraction form and data extraction was done by two reviewers. Thematic analyses were conducted manually and presented in texts, tables and flow chart. Results Only 30 full manuscripts were included in this review. Twenty-nine out of 30 studies were either hospital- or clinic-based while two were community-based. Only four studies showed gaps and obvious disparities in awareness and knowledge levels across East Africa, however, higher levels of awareness were reported among dentists and dental patients relative to the general population. Most neoplasms were presented and diagnosed late. The review finding also highlighted the significant impact of Toombak use on the oral microbiome composition, potentially contributing to oral cancer risks. Further, this review elucidated the prognostic relevance of PD-L1 expression at the invasive tumor front and microbial composition, with Candida correlating with adverse prognosis and Malassezia showing associations with improved survival rates. Also, Toombak usage, tumor staging, and mucosal field alterations emerged as predictors of local recurrence, while lymph node involvement and extranodal extension were associated with regional recurrence among Sudanese cohorts. Finally, a few studies undertook an evaluation of instrument validity for OC detection, revealing promising outcomes concerning diagnostic accuracy and instrument reliability. Conclusions There is a dire need for targeted interventions and early detection strategies tailored to the unique epidemiological and clinical profiles of oral and maxillofacial tumors in East Africa. Public health interventions aimed at curbing the prevalence of Toombak use and promoting healthier lifestyle choices to reduce the oral diseases incidence in Sudan and other regions where these behaviors are prevalent remain germane.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-21", "authors": [{"authorId": "82432403", "name": "K.

One of these strategies is the use of biological control microorganisms, such as Trichoderma, a fungus recognized as a natural enemy of the microorganisms that cause chili wilt. Therefore, this study aimed to isolate and identify Trichoderma species from the soils and roots of different plants, and evaluate their antagonism against Rhizoctonia\u00a0solani, Phytophthora\u00a0capsici, and Fusarium sp. Due to the complexity in identifying Trichoderma at the species level, performing a multilocus phylogenetic analysis was necessary, using the ITS, RPB2, and TEF1 regions. The species isolated were T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. rifaii, T. brevicompactum, T. arundinaceum, and T. longibrachiatum. Subsequently, they were used in three antagonism tests (dual culture, non-volatile organic compounds, and volatile organic compounds) against the phytopathogenic microorganisms. The tests demonstrated that the Trichoderma isolates could inhibit the mycelial growth of all three tested pathogens, obtaining the best results with the strains T. brevicompactum (19RCS), T. lentiforme (63DPS), T. longibrachiatum (71JES), T. rifaii (77JCR), and T. afroharzianum (24RQS, 87CCS, 88CCS and 17RCS).

The study was conducted from 2015 to 2024 using a total of 12,053 clinical mastitis (CM) and sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) samples. The pathogens were isolated and identified by standard bacteriological and mycological methods. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli (13.82%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.28%), Klebsiella spp. (8.96%), Streptococcus agalactiae (7.45%), Streptococcus uberis (6.60%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (5.84%), and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (4.21%). From 2015 to 2017, the primary pathogens responsible for causing mastitis in cows were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. In 2018, the most frequently isolated pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus. Notably, the isolation rate of Escherichia coli increased from 12.31% to 21.72%, and the isolation rate of Klebsiella spp. increased from 7.52% to 14.01% from 2019\u20132024. Mycoplasma was only detected in clinical mastitis cases, with a separation rate as high as 6.95%. In summary, the isolation rate of environmental pathogens is gradually increasing, while that of contagious pathogens has been continuously declining. This indicates that the current prevention strategies for infectious pathogens are effective.

Among foodstuffs, grape products can be contaminated by Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin that can occur in red grape after infection with Aspergillus carbonarius. The high affinity of grape pomace with OTA makes its use advantageous as an adsorbing/decontaminating material whether the pomace is fresh, has undergone pressing, or has undergone a stabilizing process. The effects of different grape repassage treatments on wine metabolic profiles were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with metabolomics. The relative quantification of discriminating metabolites for activated-carbon-treated samples revealed higher levels of ethyl acetate and succinate than for the grape-pomace-repassed wine samples. On the contrary, the latter exhibited a relatively high content of glycerol, lactate, tartaric, isobutanol, isopentanol, and polyphenols. Although a specific decrease in aromatic compounds such as gallic acid, tyrosine, and tyrosol was also observed compared with the controls, for the pomace-based processes, the activated carbon treatment led to a marked general impoverishment of the metabolomic profiles, with a reduction in organic acids and glycerol.

The screening of antimicrobial activity revealed 13 strains, all belonging to the Streptomyces genus, capable of inhibiting the growth of Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis or Staphylococcus aureus. Forty-three extracts exhibited cytotoxic activity against at least one tested cell line (HepG2, HCT-116 and hCMEC-D3). Three extracts that were active against the two cancer cell lines tested, did not reduce the viability of the non-cancer endothelial cell line, hCMEC-D3. One Gordonia strain exhibited anti-obesity activity, revealed by its ability to reduce the neutral lipids in zebrafish larvae. Mass spectrometry-based dereplication analysis of active extracts identified several compounds associated with known Actinomycetota natural products.

In the present study, a mycorrhizal fungus designated as BJ1 was isolated from the roots of Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Reiehb.f. Fluorescence staining and morphological analysis revealed that this fungus exhibited characteristics highly similar to those of Tulasnella. Subsequently, the strain was confirmed as a new strain of Tulasnella through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of four loci: the internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-ITS4 (ITS), ATP synthase (C14436), glutamate synthase (C4102), and ATP deconjugase (C3304). Additionally, we investigated the in vitro biological activity of strain BJ1 and its effects on germination and growth of B. striata seeds. The results indicated that BJ1 is capable of producing plant cell-degrading enzymes, including pectinase and protease. Furthermore, it demonstrates an ability to solubilize inorganic phosphorus and synthesize indoleacetic acid (IAA). Nevertheless, it does not exhibit laccase activity or possess the capacity to produce siderophores, nor can it solubilize organic phosphorus. Microscopic observations revealed that strain BJ1 mainly colonizes the base of the B. striata protocorm, thereby enhancing seed germination, growth, and expansion. Notably, by the fourth week of germination, 74.23% of seeds in the symbiotic group had developed to stage 5, a significantly higher proportion compared to 50.43% in the non-symbiotic group. Additionally, the length, width, and fresh weight of seeds in the symbiotic group were 2.2 times, 1.8 times, and 3.7 times greater than those in the non-symbiotic group, respectively. Furthermore, by adding L-tryptophan as a substrate during co-cultivation with BJ1, there was a significant enhancement in IAA synthesis capability; this also led to a marked acceleration in the symbiotic germination process of B. striata seeds. These\u00a0results suggest that strain BJ1 holds significant potential for application in the artificial propagation of B. striata seedlings.

Using metabarcoding, we investigated the epimicrobiota of S. latissima and correlated microbial diversity with metabolomic patterns (liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry). Specific epibacterial and eukaryotic communities inhabit the S. latissima surface, alongside a core microbiota, while fungal communities show lower and more heterogeneous diversity. Metabolomic analysis revealed a large diversity of mass features, including putatively annotated fatty acids, amino derivatives, amino acids, and naphthofurans. Multiple-factor analysis linked microbial diversity with surface metabolome variations, driven mainly by fungi and bacteria. Two taxa groups were identified: one associated with bacterial consortia and the other with fungal consortia, each correlated with specific metabolites. This study demonstrated a core bacterial and eukaryotic microbiota associated with a core metabolome and highlighted interindividual variations.

Previous studies have confirmed a close relation between the PWN and blue-stain fungi (Ophiostomatales), which are necrotrophic pathogens associated with bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). The PWN is able to grow densely in the presence of these fungi, which results in a higher number of nematodes transferred to the insect-vector Monochamus spp. To understand the spatial diversity and structure of Pinus pinaster mycobiome, wood samples from PWN-infected and non-infected pine trees were collected in three locations of Continental mainland Portugal with different PWD records, during the maturation phase of the insect-vector M. galloprovincialis (winter 2019-spring 2020). The PWN-mycobiome from the PWN-infected P. pinaster was also characterized. A total of 27 samples of P. pinaster and 13 samples of PWN from PWN-infected trees were characterized using ITS2 amplicon sequencing. The diversity and structure of the fungal communities in P. pinaster varied with disease status suggesting that the PWN presence affects the endophytic fungal communities. For both P. pinaster and PWN fungal communities, differences were also associated with locations (recent PWD loci Seia, and long-term PWN locus Companhia das Lez\u00edrias and Tr\u00f3ia).

To enhance their antioxidative potential under simple thermal conditions, this research employed spontaneous aging via a moist-dried heating process, primarily driven by the Maillard reaction. Honeybee brood bio-peptides (HBb-BPs), produced through Rhizopus oligosporus fermentation, were mixed with honey in varying ratios of 70:30, 50:50, and 30:70 (%w/w). The mixtures underwent interaction under controlled conditions (60 \u00b0C for 20 days at ~75% relative humidity). A comparative analysis was performed on the mixtures before and after the thermal interaction, focusing on chemical characterization and antioxidant activity (ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays). Results revealed that the post-process mixtures exhibited significantly enhanced antioxidant activity, with higher honey concentrations correlating to greater antioxidative effects. Furthermore, allulose and mannose were detected after processing, while levels of fructose, glucose, and free amino acids decreased. These changes likely indicate the formation of complex compounds, molecular rearrangements, and the production of phenolic compounds that contributed to the increased antioxidative capacity.

Pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment, a promising non-thermal technology, has been studied for its potential to inactivate microbial pathogens and mitigate infection-related stress. In this study, we investigated transcriptional responses in barley infected with Fusarium spp. during malting, both with and without PEF treatment. RNA sequencing identified over 12,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across four malting stages, with the third stage (24 h of germination) showing the highest transcriptional activity. DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways related to oxidative stress management and abscisic acid signaling, underscoring their importance in stress adaptation. Barley treated with PEF exhibited fewer DEGs in later malting stages compared to untreated samples, suggesting that PEF alleviates stress induced by both Fusarium infection and the malting process. Enrichment analysis further revealed that PEF treatment up-regulated stress-related pathways while down-regulating genes associated with photosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis.

A subset support zinc homeostasis by promoting zinc uptake and its distribution between compartments, while the remainder mediate an \u201cadaptive response\u201d to enhance fitness of zinc deficient cells. The peroxiredoxin Tsa1 is a Zap1-regulated adaptive factor essential for the growth of Zn deficient cells. Tsa1 can function as an antioxidant peroxidase, protein chaperone, or redox sensor: the latter activity oxidizes associated proteins via a redox relay mechanism. We previously reported that in Zn deficient cells, Tsa1 inhibits pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) to conserve phosphoenolpyruvate for aromatic amino acid synthesis. However, this regulation makes a relatively minor contribution to fitness in low zinc, suggesting that Tsa1 targets other pathways important to adaptation. Consistent with this model, the redox sensor function of Tsa1 was essential for growth of ZnD cells. Using an MBP-tagged version of Tsa1, we identified a redox-sensitive non-covalent interaction with Pyk1, and applied this system to identify multiple novel interacting partners. This interactome implicates Tsa1 in the regulation of critical processes including many Zn-dependent metabolic pathways. Interestingly, Zap1 was a preferred Tsa1 target, as Tsa1 strongly promoted the oxidation of Zap1 activation domain 2, and was essential for full Zap1 activity. Our findings reveal a novel posttranslational response to Zn deficiency, overlain on and interconnected with the Zap1-mediated transcriptional response.

Although they are routinely used for studying evolutionary histories and assessing new assemblies, current methods do not incorporate information from available genomic data. Here, we first determine the influence of evolutionary history on universal gene content in plants, fungi and animals. We find that across 11,098 genomes comprising 2,606 taxonomic groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages in terms of their BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs) completeness. Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of duplicated orthologs, likely as an artifact of whole genome duplication events. Secondly, we investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in BUSCO-derived whole-genome phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543 tested, sites evolving at higher rates produce at most 23.84% more taxonomically concordant, and at least 46.15% less terminally variable phylogenies compared to lower-rate sites. We find topological differences between BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees to be marginal and conclude that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments produce the most congruent and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show that BUSCO misannotations can lead to misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this issue, we filter a Curated set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false positives compared to the standard BUSCO search and introduce novel methods for comparing assemblies using BUSCO synteny.

In this second category, a TAG prodrug of the terminal sn-1 or sn-3 position of the glycerol skeleton is acylated with a single saturated medium-chain fatty acid (C6, C8, C10, or C12), and another with the drug entity; the PUFA (EPA or DHA) is located in the sn-2 position.

Methods: The essential oils were obtained through hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Chemical composition was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria, and two fungi using the broth microdilution method. Antioxidant activity was assessed using the ABTS (2,2\u2032-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assays. Additionally, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect of the essential oils was measured by a spectrophotometric method. Results and Conclusions: A total of 23 compounds were identified in the essential oil from the fruits, while 47 compounds were found in the essential oil from the leaves. The major constituents of the fruit essential oil were \u03b1-thujone (39.85%), \u03b2-thujone (25.04%), sabinene (10.71%), and terpinen-4-ol (4.38%), whereas the main compounds in the leaf essential oil were germacrene D (21.75%), nerolidol (E) (12.39%), and pentadecanal (7.14%).

However, the mitochondrial genomes of these ascomycetous fungi have not been thoroughly studied, thereby impeding a comprehensive understanding of their genetic makeup and ecological role. In this study, we analysed the mitogenomes of 30 Morchellaceae species, including yellow, black, blushing and false morels. These mitogenomes are either circular or linear DNA molecules with lengths ranging from 217 to 565 kbp and GC content ranging from 38% to 48%. Fifteen core protein-coding genes, 28\u201337 tRNA genes and 3\u20138 rRNA genes were identified in these Morchellaceae mitogenomes. The gene order demonstrated a high level of conservation, with the cox1 gene consistently positioned adjacent to the rnS gene and cob gene flanked by apt genes. Some exceptions were observed, such as the rearrangement of atp6 and rps3 in Morchellaimportuna and the reversed order of atp6 and atp8 in certain morel mitogenomes. However, the arrangement of the tRNA genes remains conserved. We additionally investigated the distribution and phylogeny of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) of the LAGLIDADG (LAGs) and GIY-YIG (GIYs) families. A total of 925 LAG and GIY sequences were detected, with individual species containing 19\u201348HEGs. These HEGs were primarily located in the cox1, cob, cox2 and nad5 introns and their presence and distribution displayed significant diversity amongst morel species.

Walnut orchards are targeted by numerous diseases, but new symptoms have been widely observed since 2015 in France, consisting in typical branch dieback and fruit blight and necrosis. Herein, both symptomatic and asymptomatic twigs and husks were collected from 12 commercial French walnut orchards from the two main production areas located in the South of France from 2020 to 2022. Overall, Botryosphaeriaceae, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, and Fusarium species were consistently isolated from symptomatic husks and twigs. Among these taxa, B. dothidea and C. godetiae were significantly more associated with symptomatic husks, contrary to D. eres and F. juglandicola, more frequently isolated from symptomatic twigs, as also confirmed by ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing. Tissue type was the primary factor significantly impacting the composition of the fungal communities (R\u00b2 = 16.6%), followed by sampling campaign and production area (R\u00b2 = 11.6% and 4.6%, respectively). We also found that Neofusicoccum and Diaporthe were significantly more associated with warm and dry years, unlike Colletotrichum. Pathogenicity tests revealed that only Botryosphaeriaceae and Diaporthe species were pathogenic on walnut fruits and twigs, with B. dothidea and N. parvum being the most aggressive species. Several significant positive and negative correlations were identified based on SparCC co-occurrence networks and correlograms based on prevalence data. In particular, the positive correlation between Colletotrichum and Fusarium species on symptomatic twigs was highlighted by both methods. This work is the first comprehensive etiological and epidemiological study of branch dieback and fruit blight and necrosis of English walnut in France. Author Summary English walnut is an economically important crop, mainly produced in China, in the United States and in Turkey while in Europe, France is one of the biggest producers. Although widespread in nut orchards abroad, new symptoms, including fruit necroses and branch dieback, were observed for the first time in 2015 in France. We then conducted sampling campaigns between 2020 and 2022 to collect walnut husks and twigs in the two main French production areas. Exploration of the associated microbiota revealed the presence of six predominant fungal species, even in samples without symptoms. We then investigated the capacity of these species to cause lesions on twigs and fruits. Among all species, Neofusicoccum parvum was the most aggressive on both organs while other species were mainly aggressive on only twigs or husks. In addition, we evidenced that the presence of some species was favored by warm and dry weather or inversely cold and wet weather. We also found negative correlations between certain species (in particular between N. parvum and Diaporthe eres), suggesting that some species probably prevented the other from further colonization. Overall, we identified the species specifically associated with the disease in France and the factors influencing the disease risk.

Processing workflows for WBS typically include sample collection, a primary concentration step, and lysis of the microbes to release nucleic acids, followed by nucleic acid purification and molecular-based quantification. This manuscript provides workflows from beginning to end with an emphasis on filtration-based concentration approaches coupled with specific lysis and nucleic acid extraction processes. Here, two WBS processing approaches are presented, one focusing on RNA-specific pathogens and the other focused on DNA-specific pathogens found within wastewater: 1) The RNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing RNA viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) couples electronegative filtration of wastewater with the placement of the filter within a lysis buffer followed by direct RNA extraction. 2) The DNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing DNA pathogens like Candida auris, uses size selection membranes during filtration, subsequently followed by a lysis buffer, bead-beating, and DNA extraction. Separate workflows for RNA versus DNA isolations have the advantage of improving the detection of the target pathogen. A novel aspect of the RNA-specific workflow is the direct extraction of nucleic acids from filter lysates, which shows enhanced recoveries, whereas the DNA-specific approach requires bead beating prior to extraction. Novelty is also provided in a new qPCR approach called Volcano 2nd Generation (V2G), which uses a polymerase capable of using RNA as a template, bypassing the reverse transcriptase step normally required for qPCR. Key features \u2022 Membrane filtration approaches for concentrating suspended solids from wastewater.

Therefore, mushrooms have been exploited by humans for centuries for dietary or medical purposes. For example, the edible and medicinal mushrooms Hericium erinaceus and Pleurotus eryngii are grown commercially around the world. In nature, H. erinaceus grows on old or dead tree trunks, and P. eryngii grows on Apiaceae plant roots, whereas in cultivation, they grow on substrates mainly consisting of dry wood chips, straw, and cereals. To make their farming more sustainable, supplements such as olive mill solid waste (OMSW) have been added to support mushroom development. However, so far, the impact of substrate additives on the edible mushroom metabolic content has not been assessed. Methods Here, we examined the effect of different proportions of OMSW added to the substrate on the metabolic profiles of the fruiting body (FB) and mycelium of H. erinaceus and P. eryngii mushrooms. We used computational metabolomics strategies including GNPS molecular networking, MS2Query, and the FERMO dashboard, to organize, annotate, and prioritize metabolite features from the untargeted Q-Exactive Plus HR-LC-MS/MS metabolomics data. Following chromatography-based fractionation, the metabolite annotation of four metabolite features was further validated or fine-tuned using 1H-NMR, to resolve structural isomers. Results & Discussion Our computational metabolomics strategies showed several annotated metabolite features to be affected by OSMW concentration. In general, the methanolic extracts of H. erinaceus FB and mycelium were more highly enriched with specialized metabolites than those of P. eryngii. Interestingly, OMSW increased several hericenone analogues in the H. erinaceus FB, to which beneficial properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer and neuroprotective properties are assigned, as well as several erinacerin metabolites from the mycelium. In addition, high concentrations of OMSW decreased the toxic enniatin metabolite abundance. In conclusion, we demonstrate how a change in substrate composition affects the mushroom\u2019s specialized metabolome and can induce beneficial mushroom metabolite diversity. These results highlight the importance of including computational metabolomic strategies to investigate new sustainable growth options for edible mushrooms and other natural foods.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/02/09/2024.02.09.579616.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2256494214", "name": "S.

We analyzed changes in the rhizosphere soil fungal communities using ITS sequencing. The results revealed that different plants affected the properties of the rhizosphere soil. The contents of organic matter, total nitrogen, and total potassium in the rhizosphere soil exhibited significant variations compared to the soil that was not occupied by plants. Soil fungal composition analysis revealed that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla in the soil of this mining area. At the genus level, compared to the mineral soil without plants, the proportion of Epicoccum increased in the rhizosphere soils of different plants, while the proportion of Fusarium decreased. Alpha diversity studies revealed that fungal diversity in the rhizospheres of different plants changed significantly. Beta diversity studies showed a significant differentiation in the fungal community structure of different plant rhizosphere soils compared to the KB group. The FunGuild predictions indicated that different plant rhizosphere soils are enriched with different guilds and trophic patterns of fungi. In addition, we found that soil physical and chemical properties were significantly correlated with the abundance and diversity of fungal communities.

Here, we conducted a field survey of microbial functional associations for 53 genes related to soil C-N-P cycling from 17 locations spanning a 30 year succession period after high-severity forest fires in the Greater Khingan Mountains (Inner Mongolia-China). We found that bacteria proliferated and dominated the competition with fungi by encoding genes for recalcitrant C decomposition, N fixation, and inorganic N cycling during the postfire early succession. Wildfire prominently decoupled the microbial functional associations of soil C-N-P cycling, particularly in organic-inorganic N turnover. However, over the 30 year succession period, these functional associations recoupled in both soil organic and mineral horizons. Notably, the decoupling of microbial functional associations recovered from a wildfire disturbance faster than the soil C-N-P imbalance.

Five typical vegetation types (i.e., coniferous forests, meadow grasslands, alpine shrubs, alpine meadows, and sparse vegetation of limestone flats) from contrasting vegetation belts were selected to explore the influence of elevation gradients on soil microbial communities. The results showed that Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the prevalent fungal phyla. Soil bacterial alpha diversity increased with increasing elevation, while soil fungal alpha diversity showed an obvious mid-elevation pattern. The beta diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities reflected a clear spatial niche-differentiation, and indicated that herbaceous plants affected soil bacterial communities while shrubs preferred soil fungal communities. A correlation analysis showed that environmental factors had different contributions to the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities.

Here, S. commune 20R-7-F01 was cultured in Cd-supplemented minimal medium (MM) to investigate the response of S. commune 20R-7-F01 to Cd exposure. We found that Cd exposure resulted in growth inhibition and a Cd-dependent increase in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO production was primarily mediated by the nitrate reductase (NR) pathway. Cd-induced growth inhibition was alleviated by inhibiting NR activity or scavenging NO, highlighting the role of NO in stress responses. Furthermore, NO was found to enhance chitinase activity, thereby promoting Cd accumulation in the fungal cell wall and leading to growth inhibition.

For this purpose, rosemary hydroalcoholic macerations were analyzed by evaluating the content of biologically active compounds, determining their antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity. Total polyphenol content (TPC), determined via the Folin\u2013Cioc\u00e2lteu method, reached 2155 \u00b1 2.45 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight in the 70% ethanol macerate (RDS2) of rosemary from Dobrogea, significantly exceeding (p < 0.05) the values observed in the Bulgarian samples. The highest antioxidant activity (745 \u00b1 2.33 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight) correlated with this extraction. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis revealed elevated calcium (119.5 mg/kg), zinc, and iron levels in Dobrogean rosemary compared to its Bulgarian counterparts. Antimicrobial assessments demonstrated that the 70% ethanol macerate (RDS2) of Dobrogean rosemary exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone: 11\u201323 mm), while its activity against Escherichia coli was moderate (10\u201317 mm at 30 \u00b5L). Candida albicans was also significantly inhibited, with an inhibition zone of 9\u201320 mm. In contrast, the Bulgarian rosemary macerate (RBS2) exhibited weak inhibition against the tested microorganisms. The higher antimicrobial activity of the RDS2 is likely due to its enriched polyphenolic content, including carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid, which are known for their bioactive properties.

The latter defines ARE ABCF proteins, known for their role in antibiotic resistance. However, in this study, we reveal a broader role of ARE ABCFs in antibiotic-responsive regulation. Using genetic, OMICs, and biochemical approaches we showed that ARE ABCF proteins TiaA and Are5sc in Streptomyces coelicolor use their resistance functions to modulate specialized metabolism and proteosynthesis in response to lincosamide, streptogramin A, and pleuromutilin (LSAP) antibiotics. Although under LSAP exposure, either Are5sc or TiaA is essential for activating the biosynthesis of the redox-active antimicrobial actinorhodin, these proteins exhibit distinct functions at the proteome level, defined by their resistance profiles and temporally regulated expression. Are5sc facilitates early adaptive responses by modulating the WblC regulon across a broad range of LSAP concentrations, while TiaA is induced later, specifically at higher concentrations, where it suppresses antibiotic stress responses, particularly against pleuromutilins. TiaA function thus reflects the ecological context of LSAP antibiotics as pleuromutilins are produced by fungi, whereas lincosamides/streptogramins originate from actinomycetes. Our findings demonstrate that ARE ABCF proteins, through their resistance function, act as global regulators of translation, mirroring the roles of non-ARE ABCF proteins like EttA. This highlights their broader ecological and physiological significance, extending beyond their established role in antibiotic resistance. IMPORTANCE Bacteria adapt to diverse stimuli mainly through transcriptional changes that regulate adaptive protein factors. Here, we show that responses to protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotics are fine-tuned by antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins at the translational level, enabling bacteria to differentiate between antibiotic classes and concentrations for a tailored response. Additionally, we have demonstrated that these proteins can specialize in conferring high-level resistance to specific antibiotics. Given their prevalence in pathogenic bacteria, ARE ABCF proteins may play a crucial role in resistance development, particularly against new antibiotics targeting the ribosomal catalytic center, presenting a significant challenge for antimicrobial therapy.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "4530070", "name": "Mark\u00e9ta Kob\u011brsk\u00e1"}, {"authorId": "2094782725", "name": "Ludmila Vesel\u00e1"}, {"authorId": "2345368694", "name": "Michaela Novotn\u00e1"}, {"authorId": "2345368849", "name": "Durga Mahor"}, {"authorId": "2334263313", "name": "Aninda Mazumdar"}, {"authorId": "2345368947", "name": "Nikola Pin\u010f\u00e1kov\u00e1"}, {"authorId": "1419232023", "name": "P.

Woody species that occur along this sharp gradient must adopt viable ecological strategies to deal with the contrasting environments of these ecosystems. For this, plants are challenged to efficiently coordinate the functioning of ecological strategy dimensions above\u2010 and below\u2010ground.\n\nWe tested hypotheses related to structural changes in vegetation and associated shifts in community\u2010level trait patterns and ecological strategies during woody plant encroachment. We surveyed 60 permanent plots in forest\u2010grassland mosaics at two different times (2012\u20132022) to obtain data on changes in vegetation structure, species composition, abundance and ecological strategies after 10\u2009years without disturbance, capturing a gradient from open and woody plant\u2010encroached grasslands to closed forests. An integrated functional approach was used to assess the different dimensions of plant trait variation, including 10 above\u2010 and below\u2010ground traits, representing whole\u2010plant, leaf, stem and root strategies.\n\nWoody plant encroachment led to a substantial increase in woody plant density in former grasslands, transforming their structure to resemble that of young forests. Interestingly, we found clear trade\u2010offs between above\u2010 and below\u2010ground traits among woody species. On the one hand, the species occurring in grassland had conservative leaves, a strategy for protection against high solar incidence, physical damage and drought, and had roots with a \u2018do\u2010it\u2010yourself\u2019 strategy, which ensures efficiency in the acquisition of nutrients and water in nutrient\u2010limited soils, and had thick bark related to fire resistance. On the other hand, forest species were usually taller and had acquisitive leaves, indicating highly competitive ability in light\u2010limited forests, whereas their roots had an \u2018outsourcing\u2019 strategy of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi in the nutrient\u2010rich soils of forests.\n\nSynthesis: We advanced the current understanding of woody plant encroachment in grasslands by showing the underlying trait\u2010based trade\u2010offs that enable woody species to occur along the transition between forest and grassland through space and time. Importantly, we have shown how below\u2010ground traits are important in explaining the species strategies, with a negative covariance between above\u2010 and below\u2010ground. Our integrative trait\u2010based approach will be helpful in better understanding and managing forest\u2010grassland mosaics in southern Brazil and analogous patchy ecosystems around the world.\n\n", "venue": "Journal of Ecology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346747134", "name": "Raissa I.

Our findings revealed that high temperatures (30 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C) significantly reduced hyphal growth, increased malondialdehyde content and antioxidant enzyme activity, and enhanced the accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids. A total of 15 candidate genes potentially responsive to high-temperature stress were identified through transcriptomic analysis, including those involved in regulating antioxidant defense, heat shock response, sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and accumulating secondary metabolites. Metabolomic analysis identified three candidate metabolites potentially responsive to high-temperature stress, including kinetin, flavonoids, and caffeic acid, as well as several metabolic pathways, including nucleotide metabolism, ABC transporters, and cofactor biosynthesis. These mechanisms help mitigate oxidative damage to cellular structures and energy deficits caused by elevated temperatures, enabling the fungus to maintain cellular stability, metabolic function, and growth under heat stress. This study is the first to explore the molecular mechanism of A. heimuer in response to high-temperature stress. The results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of heat stress tolerance in A. heimuer, highlighting potential targets for developing heat-tolerant strains for industrial application.", "venue": "Journal of Fungi", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2348702670", "name": "Fang Lu"}, {"authorId": "2347172387", "name": "Xin Sun"}, {"authorId": "152825450", "name": "Xiaodong Dai"}, {"authorId": "31943569", "name": "Piqi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "7006973", "name": "Yinpeng Ma"}, {"authorId": "2346543343", "name": "Yafei Xu"}, {"authorId": "2278214326", "name": "Lei Wang"}, {"authorId": "16076717", "name": "Jiechi Zhang"}]}, {"paperId": "6f7dc68fbdb6a9d7588bdd132c2e4ed9c6652900", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/jof11030168", "CorpusId": 276520973}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f7dc68fbdb6a9d7588bdd132c2e4ed9c6652900", "title": "Comparison of Rhizosphere Microbiomes Between Domesticated and Wild Wheat in a Typical Agricultural Field: Insights into Microbial Community Structure and Functional Shifts", "abstract": "While the differences between domesticated crops and their wild relatives have been extensively studied, less is known about their rhizosphere microbiomes, which hold potential for breeding stress-resistant traits. We compared the rhizosphere microbiomes of domesticated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its wild ancestor (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) in a typical agricultural field using 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing. Our results revealed a high level of conservation in the rhizosphere microbiomes between wild and domesticated wheat, with minimal divergence in community composition and microbial network structure. However, domesticated wheat exhibited a higher prevalence of fungal pathogens and increased functional redundancy, with significant enrichment of genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. The microbial community assemblies in both wheats were predominantly governed by deterministic processes. This suggests that long-term conventional agricultural practices have imposed minor effects on the compositional differences between the microbiomes of wild and domesticated wheat. Nonetheless, the lower abundance of apparent pathogens in the rhizosphere of the wild wheat suggests greater natural biota or innate host plant resistance against pathogenic fungi.

In this study, we identified and characterised the homologue of yeast NUC1p, termed PstNUC1, in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. PstNUC1 was induced during infection and was secreted to the extracellular space of the host. Silencing of PstNUC1 significantly attenuated the virulence of Pst, suggesting its critical role in pathogenicity. Exogenous treatment of PstNUC1 diminished the extracellular DNA (exDNA)-triggered plant immune response, including cell death, oxygen peroxide production, and upregulation of Pathogenesis-related genes. Notably, overexpression of wild-type PstNUC1, but not a signal peptide-deficient mutant (PstNUC1\u0394SP), in wheat compromised exDNA-triggered immunity, resulting in enhanced susceptibility to Pst infection.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is a crop of economic relevance in Mexico. Nuevo Le\u00f3n stands out in production; however, in the municipality of Aramberri, post-harvest losses have been reported due to diseases of unknown etiology. The objective of this work was to identify the fungi associated with the postharvest deterioration of A. sativum bulbs in Aramberri, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico and to evaluate their in vitro sensitivity to fungicides. Materials and Methods. From bulbs with evidence of deterioration and necrosis, fungi were isolated in PDA medium. Four isolates were identified by morphological analysis and one isolate from each morphological species was identified by molecular analysis. The pathogenicity of the four isolates on symptom-free bulbil was evaluated. In addition, in vitro susceptibility tests of the isolates to protective and systemic fungicides were performed. Fungicides were evaluated at three concentrations and mycelial growth reduction (MGR) and conidial germination inhibition (CGI) was estimated. Results. The fungi Alternaria embellisia and Penicillium allii were identified in association with A. sativum bulbs with postharvest deterioration. P. allii showed the ability to develop internal infections from wounds; A. embellisia only showed growth on wounds. There were significant differences (p <0.0001) in the effectiveness of fungicides on the two species. Propiconazole and copper hydroxide inhibited 100% MGR and CGI in both fungi, at all doses evaluated. Conclusion. P. allii is first reported as a causative agent of green garlic rot in Mexico.

Biological toxins have been classified into three groups: poisons transferred passively without a delivery mechanism; toxungens delivered to the body surface without an accompanying wound; and venoms conveyed to internal tissues via the creation of a wound. The distinctions highlight the evolutionary pathways by which toxins acquire specialized functions. Heretofore, the term venom has been largely restricted to animals. However, careful consideration reveals a surprising diversity of organisms that deploy toxic secretions via strategies remarkably analogous to those of venomous animals. Numerous plants inject toxins and pathogenic microorganisms into animals through stinging trichomes, thorns, spines, prickles, raphides, and silica needles. Some plants protect themselves via ants as venomous symbionts. Certain fungi deliver toxins via hyphae into infected hosts for nutritional and/or defensive purposes. Fungi can possess penetration structures, sometimes independent of the hyphae, that create a wound to facilitate toxin delivery. Some protists discharge harpoon-like extrusomes (toxicysts and nematocysts) that penetrate their prey and deliver toxins. Many bacteria possess secretion systems or contractile injection systems that can introduce toxins into targets via wounds. Viruses, though not \u201ctrue\u201d organisms according to many, include a group (the bacteriophages) which can inject nucleic acids and virion proteins into host cells that inflict damage rivaling that of conventional venoms. Collectively, these examples suggest that venom delivery systems\u2014and even toxungen delivery systems, which we briefly address\u2014are much more widespread than previously recognized. Thus, our understanding of venom as an evolutionary novelty has focused on only a small proportion of venomous organisms.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of P. cubensis extract (PCE) on depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors, and locomotor activity in mice exposed to early maternal separation. Also, we assessed the expression and methylation level of Slc6a4 and Nr3c1 in the hippocampus. Maternal separation was done in postnatal days (PNDs) 2-18. PCE was intraperitoneally injected at the dose of 20\u2005mg/kg at PND 60, and our tests were done at days 1, 3, and 10, of administration. The results showed that maternal separation significantly induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test and anxiety-like behavior in the open field test (OFT). Also, maternal separation decreased locomotor activity in the OFT. In addition, maternal separation decreased the expression and increased the methylation level of both Slc6a4 and Nr3c1 in the hippocampus. However, PCE significantly reversed all these effects. In conclusion, it seems that P. cubensis affects serotonergic signaling via altering Slc6a4 expression and methylation level in the hippocampus of mice.

Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi and ensure the coexpression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Here, we report the identification of a withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolic analyses revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed subclusters, containing several pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this subfunctionalization is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two subclusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the structural chromatin level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomics, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific subfunctionalization is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on an instance of an epigenetically modulated subfunctionalization within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defense and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and anticancer properties.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2279210450", "name": "Santiago Priego-Cubero"}, {"authorId": "2248284520", "name": "Eva Knoch"}, {"authorId": "2314783540", "name": "Zhidan Wang"}, {"authorId": "7011618", "name": "S.

Due to the widespread use of oxybenzone as an ultraviolet filter in sunscreens, it has become an emerging contaminant of concern in the environment. This concern extends to fungi, which have the potential to neutralize a wide variety of xenobiotics released into the environment. The primary objective of the study was to elucidate the alterations of antioxidant profiles of the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes in response to oxybenzone exposure. Samples with oxybenzone at a final concentration of 0.1 mg mL\u22121 were cultured in vitro with the mycelium of L. edodes for 14 days. The contents of the following antioxidant compounds were assessed: indole derivatives (6-methyl-D,L-tryptophan, tryptophan), ergothioneine, and phenolic acid (p-hydroxybenzoic acid), as well as lovastatin and ergosterol. The addition of oxybenzone negatively affected biomass growth, reducing it from 3.205 \u00b1 0.4022 g to 0.5803 \u00b1 0.1019 g. A considerable reduction in oxybenzone amounts was found in the medium after incubation (from 25 mg to 0.2993 \u00b1 0.1934 mg). After lyophilization, the mycelium contained 1.1591 \u00b1 0.0323 mg of oxybenzone. Additionally, eleven biotransformation products were assessed in the mycelium and medium samples using UPLC-Q ToF. After incubation, the transformation products were identified based on monoisotopic molecular mass and fragmentation spectra. The observed increase in the content of some antioxidants, e.g., ergothioneine, while reducing the content of others, such as lovastatin, suggests that the impact of xenobiotics on the antioxidant profile of in vitro cultures of L. edodes is complex. Marked alterations in biomass growth suggest a potential toxicological risk associated with oxybenzone.

Compared to the control group without mixed yeast strains and additives, the fermentation properties, textural properties, dynamic rheology, starch crystallinity, protein structure, water distribution, and microstructure were investigated by mixed yeast strains and additives for 14 days of long-term refrigeration. The results showed that using mixed yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metschnikowia pulcherrima; Wickerhamomyces anomalous = 0.46:0.27:0.27), \u03b1-amylase, diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono(di)glycerides and polydextrose can avoid the excessive fermentation of refrigerated dough. In addition, mixed yeast strains and additives could maintain the orderliness of the secondary structure of gluten proteins, stabilize the microstructure of starch and gluten proteins, and reduce the migration and loss of water in the dough.

Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that Solorina is polyphyletic, underscoring the need for a comprehensive taxonomic revision. Phylogenetic analyses employing Bayesian methods and Maximum Likelihood approaches based on three molecular loci (nrITS, nrLSU, mtSSU) revealed that species of Solorina segregate into two distinct clades. The first clade includes species characterized by bright orange lower surfaces that contain secondary metabolites, notably solorinic acid. The type species, Solorina crocea, is retained in the genus Solorina. The second clade encompasses species with white or brownish lower surfaces; most species lack secondary metabolites and are now classified as a new genus, Pseudosolorina. As a result of this taxonomic revision, two species: S. crocea and S. crocoides remain in the genus Solorina. Five species with white or brownish lower surfaces were transferred to the new genus Pseudosolorina, which consists of three newly described species and five new combinations. Four species previously described as Solorina:\u00a0S. embolina, S. fuegiensis, S. octospora, and S. platycarpa have morphology consistent with Pseudosolorina, but are currently retained in Solorina due to the absence of supporting DNA sequence data. A key to Solorina and Pseudosolorina is provided. The spores of S. crocea exhibit wall ornamentation featuring rounded papillae, which are distinct from those of Pseudosolorina. Molecular data and morphological characters also indicate that both Solorina and Pseudosolorina engage in symbiotic associations with photobionts cyanobacteria Nostoc and chlorophytes Coccomyxa or Asterochloris.", "venue": "Journal of Fungi", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346566859", "name": "Ting Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2269426164", "name": "Lisong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2180941429", "name": "Min Ai"}, {"authorId": "2346565419", "name": "Yuxin Gan"}, {"authorId": "2346525754", "name": "Rong Fan"}, {"authorId": "2346543680", "name": "Yingjun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "107837623", "name": "F.

Comprehensive characterization was performed using ultraviolet-visible (UV- vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X- ray diffraction. These analysis revealed the formation of spherical, crystalline nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 24nm. The FTIR analysis further revealed the presence of biomolecules responsible for caping and stabilizing the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the biosynthesized AgNPs exhibited significant antibacterial activity against pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and salmonella typhi, as well as antifungal activity against various candida species.

Their genomes encode extensive repertoires of secreted effector proteins that suppress host immunity. Here, we revised and analyzed the candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP) effectome of the powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria hordei (Bh). We identified seven putative effectors that are broadly conserved in powdery mildew species, suggesting that they are core effectors of these phytopathogens. We showed that one of these effectors, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley (Hordeum vulgare) vacuolar protein sorting 18 (VPS18) protein, a shared component of the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and homotypic fusion and protein-sorting (HOPS) endosomal tethering complexes that mediate fusion of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies, respectively, with the central vacuole. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 blocked the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, CSEP0214 inhibited the interaction between VPS18 and VPS16, which are both shared components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, introducing CSEP0214 into barley leaf cells blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity, indicating that endomembrane trafficking is required for this process. CSEP0214 expression also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures.

In the current study, the sensitivities of C. truncatum isolates to florylpicoxamid were characterized, with an average EC50 value of 0.1540 \u00b1 0.1642 \u03bcg/mL. Eleven florylpicoxamid-resistant mutants were obtained, which exhibited fitness comparable to that of the parental isolates. Florylpicoxamid treatment had a lesser impact on ATP production and the activity of the cytochrome bc1 complex in the mutants compared to the parental isolates. Overall, C. truncatum has a medium resistance risk to florylpicoxamid. Additionally, cross-resistance was not observed between florylpicoxamid and the other fungicides tested herein.

Analysis of spawn run durations across different grain substrates revealed sorghum as the most efficient, with strain LE-03 exhibiting the fastest colonization in just 13.67 days. Paddy and wheat substrates followed suit, while maize exhibited the longest colonization times across all strains. Rice bran emerged as the most efficient treatment for spawn run duration, surpassing wheat bran and groundnut oil cake, with the control group requiring the longest duration. Furthermore, examination of supplements highlighted wheat bran as consistently yielding the highest mushroom weight (750 grams of substrate-1) and biological efficiency (46.48% to 54.71%) across all strains. Rice bran also showed competitive results, particularly in yield. Groundnut oil cake consistently lagged behind in both yield and biological efficiency compared to wheat and rice bran, while the control group consistently produced the lowest results. These findings underscore the importance of substrate and supplement selection in optimizing spawn run duration, yield, and biological efficiency in Shiitake mushroom cultivation.

This coincided with the growth of the commercial nootropic (cognitive enhancers) mushroom industry, including products such as mushroom gummies marketed for \"legal highs.\" Despite these product claims, concerns have been raised about their safety profile. Our study aimed to assess the accuracy of labeling of these products and quantify their psychoactive contents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight gummy products were procured from seven different smoke and vape shops in Portland, Oregon. Gummy samples were homogenized and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Products were screened for psychoactive compounds, including psilocybin, psilocin, and their analogues, as well as for purported Amanita muscaria derivatives. Quantitative analysis of identified compounds was performed using isotope dilution.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeither ibotenic acid nor muscimol, the active components of Amanita muscaria, were detected in the two products claiming to contain Amanita muscaria extracts. However, these products contained psilocin and tryptamine derivatives. One product labeled as psilocybin-free tested positive for psilocybin. Another sample claiming to be nootropic contained undisclosed \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol. Overall, seven of the eight products contained psilocin, and six contained 4-acetoxy-N,N,dimethyltryptamine. Other detected compounds included various tryptamine congeners and kavalactones.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nLabeling was inaccurate and inconsistent in many of the products examined. Users are likely to experience psychoactive symptoms considering the concentrations of xenobiotics determined. Serotonergic effects are expected from products containing tryptamine derivatives, including those inaccurately labeled as containing Amanita muscaria extracts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe labeling of psychoactive mushroom gummies we tested was overall inaccurate. Products suggesting Amanita muscaria content instead contained serotonergic tryptamines, including some which falsely claimed to be free of psilocybin.", "venue": "Clinical toxicology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346510814", "name": "Matthew S Correia"}, {"authorId": "2346505655", "name": "Mikayla J Gonzaga"}, {"authorId": "2274227418", "name": "Courtney Temple"}, {"authorId": "2262898273", "name": "Roy R.

This study investigates the interactions between Cyperus rotundus, a widespread invasive weed, and fungal communities in the mangrove-adjacent wetlands of Isla Santay, Ecuador. Using metagenomic sequencing of the ITS region, we analyzed fungal diversity in samples from an anthropogenically pressured area and a non-impacted site. Results revealed significant differences in microbial assemblages: the rhizosphere sample from the disturbed area exhibited lower fungal richness and was dominated by Magnaporthaceae (9%) and Aureobasidium melanogenum (5%), both associated with stress-tolerant traits. In contrast, the rhizosphere sample from the non-impacted site showed higher species diversity, with Cladosporium dominicanum (62%) and Talaromyces (11%) as dominant endophytic taxa. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and co-occurrence networks highlighted distinct fungal partitioning between the two sample tissues, indicating that C. rotundus mediates microbial composition in response to environmental gradients. These findings underscore the role of microbial communities in the plant\u2019s invasive success and suggest that leveraging beneficial fungi could enhance ecosystem resilience and support wetland restoration.

L. pneumophila naturally thrives within protozoan hosts in aquatic environments, which serve as reservoirs for bacterial replication and transmission. Inhalation of contaminated aerosols delivers L. pneumophila to the lungs where it is able to infect human alveolar macrophages and multiply intracellularly inside a membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The main virulence factor of the bacteria is the Icm/Dot type IVb secretion system, responsible for the translocation of over 300 bacterial effector proteins into host cells. These effectors allow the remodelation of the LCV into a replication-competent compartment that seggregates from the phagolysosomal pathway. After being translocated into host cells, L. pneumophila effector VipA associates with early endosomes and F-actin. VipA increases the polymerization of actin filaments in vitro by promoting the nucleation step without the requirement of additional partners, and impairs vesicle trafficking in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, we sought the interacting partners of VipA in early endosomes and explored the effects of this association. We found that VipA interacts directly to two key components of these organelles, the membrane lipid PI3P and the small GTPase Rab5. Binding to Rab5 requires the N-terminal region of VipA but not the C-terminal/actin-binding region. Furthermore, binding to Rab5 inhibits VipA-mediated actin polymerization by preventing de novo actin filament formation. These findings offer new insights into VipA\u2019s mode of action and underscore the intricate interactions between L. pneumophila effectors and their host cell targets, namely the endocytic pathway.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346327867", "name": "Joana Saraiva"}, {"authorId": "7586178", "name": "Joana N.

Turf-grasses are widely distributed in landscapes, slopes and sport fields, such as golf courses. Endophytic fungi are a resource of unexplored fungal diversity with potential bioactive compounds. In this study, culture-independent ITS amplicon sequencing and culture-dependent isolation methods were used to reveal fungal community in roots of the turf-grass Zoysiajaponica. A total of 317 OTUs were identified from root samples of Z.japonica by analysis of ITS amplicon reads. Fungal community was dominated by Sordariales (32.45%), followed by Chaetothyriales (18.16%), unknown taxa in Sordariomycetes (14.63%) and Pleosporales (12.48%). During isolation, 151 endophytic fungal strains were obtained from roots of Z.japonica and a variety of taxa were found by ITS amplification and sequencing. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungal species were further characterised in this study, based on morphological characterisation and multi-loci phylogenetic analysis, including Niessliadimorphospora, a newly-recorded species in Korea and 10 novel species (Dactylariahwasunensissp. nov., Lophiostomajeollanense sp. nov., Magnaporthiopsiszoysiaesp. nov., Poaceascomaendophyticumsp. nov., P.koreanumsp. nov., P.magnumsp. nov., P.zoysiiradicicolasp. nov., Stagonosporaendophytica sp. nov., Setophomazoysiaesp. nov. and Pseudorhypophilapoaesp. nov.). Antifungal activities of these species were tested against the turf-grass brown patch pathogen Rhizoctoniasolani AG2-2(IIIB), with S.zoysiae being the best antagonist. In addition, butanol extract from mycelia of S.zoysiae strongly inhibited R.solani AG2-2(IIIB) in vitro and in planta.

In this review, we explore the environmental conditions and production practices that make the must of cooked agave stems a unique habitat for colonizing microorganisms. Additionally, we review selected studies that have characterized yeast species within these communities, with a focus on their metabolic traits and genomic features. Over 50 fungal species, predominantly Saccharomycetales and few Basidiomycetes, along with a similar number of lactic and acetic acid bacteria, have been identified. Despite variations in the chemical composition of the agave substrates and diversity of cultural practices associated with each traditional fermentation process, yeast species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Torulaspora delbrueckii, and several Pichia species have been consistently isolated across all agave spirit-producing regions. Importantly, cooked agave must is rich in fermentable sugars, yet it also contains inhibitory compounds that influence the proliferation dynamics of the microbial community. We discuss some of the genetic traits that may enable yeasts to flourish in this challenging environment and how human practices may shape microbial diversity by promoting the selection of microbes that are well-adapted to agave fermentation environments.

We previously found that Sclerotinia sclerotiorum endornavirus 3 (SsEV3), belonging to the genus Betaendornavirus within the family Endornaviridae, confers hypovirulence on the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, but the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. In this study, we found that the SsEV3-infected strain produced fewer sclerotia, failed to form infection cushions on plant hosts, exhibited increased cell vacuolation, and was more sensitive to abiotic stresses. SsEV3 infection evoked transcriptional rewiring in S. sclerotiorum, affecting genes related to virulence factors for pathogenicity and RNAi pathway for antiviruses. An unknown biological function of gene Sssnf1 was downregulated following SsEV3 infection. Deletion of Sssnf1 impaired infection cushion formation and decreased virulence of S. sclerotiorum. Five key RNAi-related genes were significantly upregulated, and deletion of Ssdcl2 contributed to SsEV3 accumulation. Additionally, we identified a hypothetical protein encoded by Sshp1 that directly interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain encoded by SsEV3. Although the deletion mutants of Sshp1 exhibited normal colony morphology, they showed higher SsEV3 accumulation and reduced resistance to reactive oxygen species, indicating that this gene, similar to RNAi-related genes, plays an antiviral role in response to SsEV3 infection and may represent a new antivirus factor. Therefore, examination of the interaction between endornavirus and S. sclerotiorum provides new insights into the mechanisms of antivirus and virulence in phytopathogenic fungi.IMPORTANCEHypovirulence-associated mycoviruses have emerged as promising biocontrol agents, and studying their interactions with phytopathogenic fungi helps uncover mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis and antiviral defense. This study provides critical insights into the interaction between Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and its hypovirulence-associated endornavirus, SsEV3, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying mycovirus-induced changes in fungal virulence and antivirus defense. SsEV3 infection not only impairs fungal virulence traits, including infection cushion formation and sclerotial production but also triggers host antiviral responses involving typical RNA interference pathways. New virulence factors, such as Sssnf1, and antiviral factors, such as Sshp1, were identified based on the established interaction system between S. sclerotiorum and endornavirus. These findings deepen our understanding of fungus-mycovirus interactions, highlighting the role of SsEV3 in reducing the virulence of S. sclerotiorum, and facilitating the development of mycovirus-based biological control strategies.", "venue": "mBio", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "152338989", "name": "Fan Mu"}, {"authorId": "2303615352", "name": "Jinsheng Xia"}, {"authorId": "28295146", "name": "Jichun Jia"}, {"authorId": "6798834", "name": "D.

Using an in vitro quantitative suspension test and electron microscopy, we have demonstrated the virucidal efficacy of SDS combinations with citric or glutamic acids on FCV.

Merr.) production, with Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein.) Petch) emerging as a significant threat within the seedling disease complex. Its cross-pathogenicity on wheat and maize, along with increasing reports of fungicide resistance, highlights the need for improved genetic resistance in soybean. In a previous germplasm screening and genome-wide association study (GWAS) we identified a significantly resistant accession, PI 438500, from a panel of 208 diverse soybean accessions. This accession carried fewer marker-trait associations (MTAs) and lower predicted resistance than other significantly resistant accessions yet displayed a highly resistant phenotype with low standard deviations. In this study, we developed an F2:3 mapping population from a bi-parental cross between PI 438500 and PI 548631 (highly susceptible to F. graminearum) and identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that explains 20.29% of the variation in post-emergent visual severity. This QTL region contains multiple candidate genes with predicted roles in plant defense mechanisms and helps elucidate PI 438500's significant resistance to F. graminearum.

More detailed evaluation of five such drugs, including the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib, indicated they promote C. albicans survival following exposure to the echinocandin antifungals. The activity of the five selected antagonists was dependent upon the Mkc1p MAPK pathway, however, ponatinib was paradoxically shown to suppress phosphorylation and therefore activation of Mkc1p itself. Components of several other signaling pathways are also required, including those of calcineurin and casein kinase-2, suggesting the observed antagonism required much of the cell wall stress responses previously described for C. albicans. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the antagonists stimulated the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic and antifungal resistance, and suppressed the expression of genes associated with hyphal growth. Thus, the echinocandin antagonistic drugs modulate C. albicans physiology in ways that could impact its pathogenicity and/or response to therapeutic intervention. Finally, a mutant lacking the Efg1p transcription factor, which has a central role in the activation of C. albicans hyphal growth was found to have intrinsically high levels of echinocandin tolerance, suggesting a link between modulation of morphogenesis related signaling and echinocandin tolerance. Importance We report a substantial number of previously unknown drug interactions that modulate the echinocandin sensitivity of one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens, Candida albicans. The echinocandins are the first line therapy for treating disseminated and often lethal Candida infections, that account for >75% of invasive fungal infections in the U.S.. For largely unknown reasons, a substantial number of patients with invasive candidiasis fail to respond to treatment with these drugs. The finding of this study suggest that co-administered medications have the potential to influence the therapeutic outcomes of invasive fungal infections through modulating antifungal drug tolerance and/or fungal pathogenicity.

To reduce the reliance on insecticides for managing this pest, alternative strategies like behavioral manipulation are needed. Previous studies have shown that D. suzukii adults avoid blueberry fruits infected with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae Marcelino & Gouli, which causes anthracnose fruit rot, leading to the identification of 9 potential repellent compounds. In this study, we further investigated the two most potent of these compounds-ethyl butanoate and ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate-to assess their repellent properties on the antennal and behavioral responses of D. suzukii. Electroantennogram (EAG) assays revealed that both esters elicited similar dose-dependent responses in male and female D. suzukii, which were often stronger than those triggered by 2-pentylfuran, a known repellent of this species. Additionally, we examined the behavioral responses of adult D. suzukii to these 3 repellent compounds under semi-field and field conditions using outdoor cages containing potted and planted blueberry bushes, respectively. Results from the cage studies showed that all 3 tested compounds can significantly reduce D. suzukii oviposition and adult emergence from blueberry fruits, with ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate sometimes outperforming the other compounds. Our findings indicate that the esters ethyl butanoate and ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate, which are induced from C. fioriniae-infected blueberries, elicit dose-dependent effects on D. suzukii antennae and act as effective oviposition deterrents.

Soil microbes showed strong habitat specificity during meadow degradation, but we poorly understood the ecological assembly processes in soil microbial communities. This study explores the changes in ecological components across original and degraded patches of alpine meadows in SJY National Park. We examined vegetation-soil characteristics through field surveys, and soil microbial community structure by using high-throughput sequencing techniques. At the macro level, alpine meadows degradation increased vegetation species diversity, significantly reduced above-ground productivity, and made the soil more barren and alkaline. At the micro level, although the dominant phyla of soil microorganisms were similar in different degradation states of alpine meadows, degradation significantly increased the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria and decreased the relative abundance of dominant fungi. Additionally, microbial communities exhibited significant \u03b2-diversity. Degradation also led to an increase in microbial \u03b1-diversity, heightened microbial taxa competition, and a more complex microbial co-occurrence network. However, vegetation-soil variables explained only a small portion of the variation in soil microbes. Through the study of microbial ecological assembly processes, it was found that degradation enhanced the stochastic processes of soil microbial communities, and the changes in soil microbial communities were mainly driven by the variations inherent in the microbes themselves. These findings highlight the complex ecological interactions between above- and below-ground components, and emphasize the critical role of microbial community dynamics in ecosystem functions.", "venue": "Journal of Plant Ecology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "2217098561", "name": "Xin Chen"}, {"authorId": "2247896731", "name": "Qi Li"}, {"authorId": "2158191883", "name": "Dongdong Chen"}, {"authorId": "2267009603", "name": "Liang Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2075319685", "name": "Chun Xiao"}]}, {"paperId": "732d6192f6f49e4666a2617acdcac5d4fddea7a9", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.9734/ajraf/2025/v11i1376", "CorpusId": 276493173}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/732d6192f6f49e4666a2617acdcac5d4fddea7a9", "title": "Performance of Starter Broiler Chickens Fed Diets Containing Rejected Mango Fruit Pulp and Maize Offal Mix", "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the performance of broiler chickens fed diets containing rejected mango fruit pulp - maize offal mix. The extracted mango pulp was evenly mixed with maize offal (Dusa) in a ratio of 2:3 (RMFP: MOM). The mixture was sun dried for 5 days until moisture of less than 12% was achieved. Five diets were prepared in which RMFP-MOM partially replaced maize at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% representing treatments T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. A total of (200) day-old ROSS chicks averaged 44.24 g were randomly allocated to 5 dietary treatments, balancing for body weight. Each treatment group made up of forty birds, was replicated four times and each replicate had ten (10) birds in a completely randomized design (CRD). Result of the proximate analysis revealed that, RMFP-MOM contains 9.59 % crude protein, 0.99% ether extract, 3.02 %, moisture, 11.51 % crude fibre, ash was 5.47 %, 75.85 % nitrogen free extract and 3127.79 kcal/kg metabolizable energy. Phytochemicals and minerals found included Phytates (0.13%), tannin (2.53%), mycotoxin (3.76%), citric acid (0.1%), calcium (0.98%) and phosphorus (0.17%) while ADF, NDF and hemicellulose were found at levels of 10.10 %, 45.10% and 35.00 % respectively. Result on performance of the starter broiler chickens revealed significant effects (p<0.05) of RMFP-MOM on final body weight (FBW), daily weight gain (DWG) and daily feed intake (DFI) which all declined at T5 (20 % RMFP-MOM). Result on digestibility showed that, there was significantly lower (p<0.05) digestibility of ether extract in T1 (80.73 %). Cost of feed consumed was significantly lower (p<0.05) at T5. Gross revenue was \u20a64000 across treatments while gross profit was higher at T5. Given the nutrients profile of RMFP-MOM as revealed by the result of the proximate analysis, it was inferred that these materials are valuable feedstuff in broiler nutrition as the use of RMFP-MOM in the diets of the broiler chicken up to 15% maintained growth rates at levels comparable to the control. The result of this study also revealed that broiler chickens can be reared at cheaper cost with the inclusion of RMFP-MOM at 15%. It was recommended that, 15 % RMFP-MOM be used in broiler diets.", "venue": "Asian Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346343166", "name": "Aondoakaa, R.
