Several cases of novel horizontally acquired genetic material associated with adaptive traits have been recently described, contained within giant transposons named Starships. While a handful of Starships have been identified in domesticated species, their abundance has not yet been systematically explored in human-associated fungi. Here, we investigated whether Starships have shaped the genomes of two major genera of fungi occurring in food and clinical environments, Aspergillus and Penicillium. Using seven independent domestication events, we found in all cases that the domesticated strains or species exhibited significantly greater Starship content compared with close relatives from non-human-related environments. We found a similar pattern in clinical contexts. Our findings have clear implications for agriculture, human health and the food industry as we implicate Starships as a widely recurrent mechanism of gene transfer aiding the rapid adaptation of fungi to novel environments.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-01-30", "authors": [{"authorId": "1404322588", "name": "Samuel O'donnell"}, {"authorId": "2310322390", "name": "Gabriela Rezende"}, {"authorId": "66924229", "name": "Jean-Philippe Vernadet"}, {"authorId": "5903116", "name": "A.

We tested this hypothesis using adaptive laboratory evolution of thermotolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that the cells reproducibly evolved better proteostasis capacity in short-term evolution experiments. However, rather than improving the global proteostasis capacity, most of the evolved strains demonstrated enhanced capacity to tackle misfolding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), specifically by increasing their capacity for ER-associated degradation (ERAD).

The findings provide new host records for these species and indicate that their host ranges span multiple families. Notably, all Xiphydria species had female-biased sex ratios. All adult females had gourd-shaped eggs, similar to those found in gall wasps (Cynipidae), which contrast with the oval-shaped eggs of Siricidae.

To date, studies on artificial reefs have taken a macroscopic perspective, with few studies having investigated the fungal communities in artificial reefs in the North Yellow Sea. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the distribution patterns of seawater quality, sediment properties, and fungal communities following the placement of artificial reefs of different materials in the North Yellow Sea. A sampling survey of marine ranching in the northern Yellow Sea was conducted in August 2023. Sediment and seawater samples were collected from the stone and concrete artificial reef areas as well as from the areas without constructed reefs as a control. Research shows that the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were higher in the concrete reef than that in the other two regions. We obtained 735 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which were assigned to 11 phyla and 374 genera. Significant differences in the beta-diversity of the fungal communities were found among the three sampling regions, and the dominant species varied in seawater and sediment samples from different reef areas. Ascomycota was the most abundant phylum in the seawater and sediment samples, followed by Basidiomycota. pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) emerged as the most important factors affecting fungal communities in the seawater samples, whereas mean grain size, TN, and TOC had a significant effect on the communities in the sediments, with TP and TOC playing the most critical roles.

CRISPR-Cas systems are found in Bombella apis, a microbe associated with honey bee queens, brood, and royal jelly. Unlike other honey bee microbiome members, B. apis does not colonize the worker bee midgut or hindgut and has therefore been understudied with regards to its importance in the honey bee colony. However, B. apis appears to play beneficial roles in the colony, by protecting developing brood from fungal pathogens and by bolstering their development under nutritional stress. Previously we identified CRISPR-Cas systems as being acquired by B. apis in its transition to bee association, as they are absent in a sister clade. Here we assess the variation and distribution of CRISPR-Cas types across B. apis strains. We found multiple CRISPR-Cas types, some of which have multiple arrays, within the same B. apis genomes and also in the honey bee queen gut metagenomes. We analyzed the spacers between strains to identify the history of mobile element interaction for each B. apis strain. Finally, we predict interactions between viral sequences and CRISPR systems from different honey bee microbiome members. Our analyses show that the B. apis CRISPR-Cas systems are dynamic, that microbes in the same niche have unique spacers which supports the functionality of these CRISPR-Cas systems, and that acquisition of new spacers may be occurring in multiple locations in the genome, allowing for a flexible antiviral arsenal for the microbe. IMPORTANCE Honey bee worker gut microbes have been implicated in everything from protection from pathogens to breakdown of complex polysaccharides in the diet. However, there are multiple niches within a honey bee colony that host a different group of microbes, including the acetic acid bacterium Bombella apis. B. apis is found in the colony food stores, in association with brood, in worker hypopharyngeal glands, and in the queen digestive tract. The roles that B. apis may serve in these environments are just beginning to be discovered and include production of a potent antifungal that protects developing bees and supplementation of dietary lysine to young larvae, bol-stering their nutrition. Niche specificity in B. apis may be affected by the pressures of bacteriophage and other mobile elements which may target different strains in each specific bee environment. Studying the interplay between B. apis and its mobile genetic elements (MGEs) may help us better understand microbial community dynamics within the colony and the potential ramifications for the honey bee host.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-05", "authors": [{"authorId": "2280318686", "name": "Carrie L Ganote"}, {"authorId": "2280320610", "name": "L\u00edlian Caesar"}, {"authorId": "2280316429", "name": "Danny W.

However, one of the challenges of using TWW as an irrigation source is the accumulation of non-essential toxic elements in soil post-irrigation. Thus, this study determined whether indigenous microbes that are tolerant to toxic elements would remediate non-essential toxic elements in contaminated soil following irrigation with TWW. Soil from a fallowed field at the University of Limpopo Experimental Farm was irrigated with TWW in pots for 12 weeks. After that, an incubation study was established to assess the abilities of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to remediate the contaminated soil over 12 weeks. Both water and soil samples (non-contaminated, contaminated, and remediated) were analysed for toxic elements: Aluminium (Al), Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd), and Lead (Pb). Data were analysed using GenStat 20th edition. The results revealed that irrigation with TWW increased the concentration of non-essential toxic elements in soil by 110%, 31%, 31%, 31%, and 54% for Al, As, Cr, Cd, and Pb, respectively. The inoculation of soil with indigenous microbes led to the decline in the concentration of non-essential toxic elements in soil. Furthermore, soils inoculated with S. aureus led to a reduction in Cr to levels below those observed prior to irrigation with TWW. Overall, the findings of the study effectively convey that these indigenous microbes can be used for bioremediation.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-21", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346741425", "name": "Itumeleng Kgobokanang Jacob Kekana"}, {"authorId": "82115507", "name": "P.

The present study aims to find out the biodegradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using both pure microbial strains TA1 (Aspergillus tubignesis), TA2 (Aspergillus fumigatus), TA3 (Aspergillus niger), TA6 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), TA7, and TA8 (Proteus mirabilis) and a consortium of these strains under pot conditions. Methods The experiment used sterilized dumpsite soil surface-sterilized with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 3 minutes, rinsed with distilled water, and dried pots. A completely randomized design (CRD) was used with 32 treatments submerged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic of two thicknesses: 25 microns and 40 microns. Each treatment was replicated three times and conducted over two intervals: 6 months and 9 months. Results The results showed that the maximum biodegradation of 25-micron-thick LDPE films was achieved using the pure fungal isolate Aspergillus niger (TA3) 13.69%, followed by Aspergillus fumigatus (TA2) 11.9% and Aspergillus tubignesis (TA1) 10.54% after 9 months. For 40-micron-thick LDPE films, the degradation rates were 7.8%, 5.8%, and 4.6% respectively. Using a consortium of three fungal species resulted in a maximum weight loss of 19.17% for 25-micron-thick LDPE bags and 9.8% for 40-micron-thick LDPE bags over the same period. FTIR analysis revealed changes in the functional groups on the LDPE surface, indicating hydrocarbon degradation. Conclusion The study found that pure microorganisms resulted in less weight loss compared to microbial consortia, and fungi were more effective than bacteria in degrading the LDPE plastic.

Here, we examined sex differences in mating phenology of Myotis lucifugus to understand how reproductive strategies contribute to disease impacts as the mating season coincides with exposure to a lethal fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We expected differences in activity among sexes to modify seasonal disease dynamics as P. destructans can replicate only at the cool temperatures at which bats hibernate. We used passive antenna systems installed at the entrances of hibernacula and PIT tags to characterize activity patterns of bats impacted by white-nose syndrome. We also measured pathogen loads on bats during autumn mating and early hibernation to assess how infection severity changed according to host phenology. We found that females spent fewer days active during autumn, arrived after males, and were primarily active on the warmest nights. Males remained highly active throughout the mating period and later in autumn than females. Importantly, these differences in mating phenology corresponded to more severe infections in females during early hibernation as male activity, and thus warm body temperatures, inhibit pathogen growth. Differences in activity between sexes and in the transition from swarm to hibernation likely reflects males maximizing their mating opportunities while females conserve energy to meet the cost of spring migration and reproduction.

However, the majority of extant methods for assessing biological integrity concentrate on monitoring at a single trophic level, and there is a paucity of systematic studies that consider multi-trophic level biomes in an integrated manner. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the multi-trophic biotic communities in the downstream section of the Gezhou Dam in the Yangtze River mainstem, which formerly constituted Chinese sturgeon spawning grounds, utilizing eDNA metabarcoding technology. Furthermore, the objective was to establish a multi-trophic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) assessment system. In this study, we sampled 18 sampling sites in three time periods, and reference sites were selected based on a number of factors, including the distance between the sampling site and the outfall, the extent of vegetation cover, and the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The biological integrity of the sampling sites was then compared over different time periods (before, during, and after spawning season). The eDNA analysis enabled the construction of comprehensive biological integrity indicators, which considered fish, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, fungi, and microbial communities (It should be noted that due to the overlap of information and the weak indication of integrity of the indicators, the final indicator system will not include all taxa, but only some of them). The results demonstrated that the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores of the reference and disturbance sites exhibited notable differences in both individual and whole time periods (p < 0.05), with an observed tendency for increased integrity with distance from the dam. Positive linear correlation was observed between IBI scores and sturgeon eDNA concentrations at all sampling sites. The assessment outcomes exhibited satisfactory indicative capacity and spatial and temporal consistency, providing a reliable foundation for an ecosystem health assessment.

The urgent need for sensitive and sustainable detection methods has driven the development of diverse analytical approaches, most of which heavily rely on organic solvents, posing environmental challenges for routine food safety analysis. Here, we introduce a supramolecular platform leveraging acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (acCB) as a host molecule for environmentally sustainable AFB1 detection. Screening various acCB derivatives identified acCB6 as a superior host capable of forming a stable 1:1 complex with AFB1 in an aqueous solution, exhibiting a high binding affinity. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy confirmed that AFB1 was deeply encapsulated within the host cavity, with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments and molecular dynamics simulations further substantiating the stability of the interaction, driven by enthalpic and entropic contributions. This supramolecular host was incorporated into a scaffold-assembly-based bioluminescent enzyme immunoassay (SA-BLEIA), providing a green detection platform that rivals the performance of traditional organic solvent-based assays.

Atomic adsorption spectroscopy was used to select the most feasible method for applying a cupril solution onto wood surfaces. The fungicidal and antibacterial activity of the obtained antiseptic was studied. The most feasible method for covering wood surfaces with a cupril solution was found to be its application followed by thermal drying (105 \u00b0C). Cupril with medium- and high-molecular weights was established to be most active against fungi of different taxonomic groups, including Trichaptum laricinum, Trichoderma harzianum, Hormonema macrosporum, also exhibiting activity against such copper-resistant fungi as Fomitopsis pinicola.

Dragon fruit (Hylocereus spp.) has been known to be a rich source of bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins, betacyanin, betaxanthin and other phenolic substances, and possesses a nutritional profile suitable to produce wine with functional properties. The aim of this study was to characterize the wine fermentation from red dragon fruit juice by a newly identified yeast strain.\nExperimental approach. Yeast strains from banh men, a Vietnamese traditional alcoholic fermentation starter, were screened for ethanol production using thermally pretreated red dragon fruit juice. The most potent candidate was identified by the DNA sequencing method and subjected to an optimization study using a one-factor-at-a-time approach to optimize the conditions for red dragon fruit wine fermentation. \nResults and conclusions. Results showed that thermal pretreatment of the red dragon fruit juice at 70 \u00b0C for 10 mins resulted in a higher level of phenolic and antioxidants compared with other pretreatment temperatures. Among the 4 isolates, M7 was the most potent alcohol fermenter, which was then identified to be Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a DNA sequencing method. The optimal conditions for wine fermentation from red dragon fruit juice by S. cerevisiae M7 included a pitching rate of 108 CFU/mL, an initial sucrose content of 18 % m/V, an initial pH of 4.5, fermentation temperature of 30 \u00b0C and a fermentation time of 6 days.

DNA metabarcoding is widely used to characterize these biological communities, by amplifying \u201cbarcode\u201d regions and sequencing these amplicons via next-generation sequencing. The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) adopted the use of indexed primers, PCR primers containing Illumina\u00ae adapter sequences and a unique 12-nucleotide Golay barcode to simplify the identification of bacterial taxa via the 16S barcode. We sought to develop a wet laboratory workflow utilizing indexed primers that could cost-effectively reduce bench time while simultaneously targeting multiple DNA barcode regions to characterize bacterial (16S), fungal (ITS1), plant (ITS2, trnL p6 loop), and arthropod (COI) communities. The EMP primer constructs for 16S were modified to accommodate our DNA barcode regions of interest while also permitting successful demultiplexing following sequencing. A single indexed primer pair was designed for ITS1 and trnL p6 loop, and two primer pairs were developed for ITS2 and COI. To test the workflow, a total of 648 soil and 336 dust samples were processed, with key steps including DNA isolation, total DNA quantification, amplification with indexed primers, library purification and quantification, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Based on raw read counts and analysis of positive controls, the trnL p6 loop and ITS2 a primer pairs performed comparably to the originally designed 16S primers. Both COI primers pairs, ITS1 and ITS2 b primers, had lower raw reads compared to the other three primer pairs. The combination of the three plant targets successfully recovered all plant taxa in the positive controls except for Nephrolepis exaltata [Nephrolepidaceae] and the COI primers recovered all arthropod taxa except for the beetle. Notably, none of the taxa in the fungal positive control were recovered using ITS1. For environmental samples, sequencing was successful for all primers except COI c, and primer biases were observed for all three plant primers, in which a small number of families were uniquely amplified for each primer pair.

Genome editing methods have high efficiency, controlled, and directional editing qualities, so their use in agriculture has increased significantly in recent years. Breeding-resistant variants might greatly benefit from the deployment of genome editing methods. These strategies have produced amazing results when it comes to the resistant breeding of significant agricultural crops. One of the most effective, practical, and quick methods for successfully manipulating the target gene is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. The Cas9 protein, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, causes a site-specific double-strand break that starts a DNA repair process and modifies the genome. Despite possessing two layers of defensive mechanisms: Effectors-triggered immunity (ETI) and PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, plants are susceptible to phytopathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses). The genome has been edited using CRISPR-Cas technology to strengthen plant immunity and provide long-term resistance to pathogens and insects. To improve plant life and resistance, this review explains the functions of CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing in plants against various biotic stresses.

Foc is responsible for sever yield losses of up to 90% in commercial and local banana cultivars planted in southern Ethiopia. However, there is limited research information about its epidemiology, distribution, and relative importance of the disease in the country particularly in Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia, where banana is dominantly grown. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate and analyze the distribution, importance, and intensity of the disease and its association with biophysical factors. Fields surveys were conducted in three major banana\u2010growing districts of Gamo zone in Arba Minch Zuria, Mirab Abaya, and Daramalo during the 2019/2020 cropping season in which a total of 90 fields were surveyed. The association of the disease incidence and severity with independent variables was analyzed using a logistic regression model in SAS under the GENMOD procedures. The results of the survey study indicated that Fusarium wilt was widely distributed all the three districts, regardless of agro\u2010ecological factors. The highest mean incidence (47.37%) and severity (46.31%) values were recorded at Daramalo, while the lowest incidence (20.75%) and severity (28.63%) values were recorded from Arba Minch Zuria district. Variables such as banana cultivars, age of plantations, weeding practices, and disease management methods were significantly associated with the incidence and severity of the disease. The use of improved cultivars reduced disease incidence by 43.60% and the severity by 30.10%, compared to that of local ones.

Walnut orchards are targeted by numerous diseases, but new symptoms have been widely observed since 2015 in France, consisting in typical branch dieback and fruit blight and necrosis. Herein, both symptomatic and asymptomatic twigs and husks were collected from 12 commercial French walnut orchards from the two main production areas located in the South of France from 2020 to 2022. Overall, Botryosphaeriaceae, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, and Fusarium species were consistently isolated from symptomatic husks and twigs. Among these taxa, B. dothidea and C. godetiae were significantly more associated with symptomatic husks, contrary to D. eres and F. juglandicola, more frequently isolated from symptomatic twigs, as also confirmed by ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing. Tissue type was the primary factor significantly impacting the composition of the fungal communities (R\u00b2 = 16.6%), followed by sampling campaign and production area (R\u00b2 = 11.6% and 4.6%, respectively). We also found that Neofusicoccum and Diaporthe were significantly more associated with warm and dry years, unlike Colletotrichum. Pathogenicity tests revealed that only Botryosphaeriaceae and Diaporthe species were pathogenic on walnut fruits and twigs, with B. dothidea and N. parvum being the most aggressive species. Several significant positive and negative correlations were identified based on SparCC co-occurrence networks and correlograms based on prevalence data. In particular, the positive correlation between Colletotrichum and Fusarium species on symptomatic twigs was highlighted by both methods. This work is the first comprehensive etiological and epidemiological study of branch dieback and fruit blight and necrosis of English walnut in France. Author Summary English walnut is an economically important crop, mainly produced in China, in the United States and in Turkey while in Europe, France is one of the biggest producers. Although widespread in nut orchards abroad, new symptoms, including fruit necroses and branch dieback, were observed for the first time in 2015 in France. We then conducted sampling campaigns between 2020 and 2022 to collect walnut husks and twigs in the two main French production areas. Exploration of the associated microbiota revealed the presence of six predominant fungal species, even in samples without symptoms. We then investigated the capacity of these species to cause lesions on twigs and fruits. Among all species, Neofusicoccum parvum was the most aggressive on both organs while other species were mainly aggressive on only twigs or husks. In addition, we evidenced that the presence of some species was favored by warm and dry weather or inversely cold and wet weather. We also found negative correlations between certain species (in particular between N. parvum and Diaporthe eres), suggesting that some species probably prevented the other from further colonization. Overall, we identified the species specifically associated with the disease in France and the factors influencing the disease risk.

Here we use a PSF model to study the conditions under which soil-associated fungi invade a community of two plant species and their associated microbiomes at different stages of assembly. We manipulate fungal colonization timing, initial plant and microbiome evenness, and properties of all actors, then analyze the resulting community structure. Microbial invasion is most successful early in community assembly. However, invasion outcomes are highly variable across colonization timing. We derive an expression showing that the net support for the invader by the plants determines invasion success. When successful, the invader disrupts the negative feedback among the plants and their microbiomes that enables plant coexistence. Our results highlight the importance of plant-microbial interactions in microbial invasion success, as well as the susceptibility of plant coexistence to soil-associated microbial invaders during transient dynamics.

These genomic regions evolve rapidly, accumulating genes important in pathogenicity but also harboring significant amounts of transposable elements (TEs). This duality suggests a trade-off: accessory chromosomes provide infection-related benefits while otherwise being deleterious due to their highly repetitive nature and contributions to genomic instability. Despite this, accessory chromosomes often appear to be stably maintained even when strains are grown on media, with no plant host. Previously, we had observed that genes homologous to meiotic drive toxin/antidote proteins from Podospora anserina (Spoks) are abundant on accessory chromosomes in various Fusarium species. Using a functionality screen in yeast, we demonstrate that some of these homologs have active toxin and antidote properties. We propose that these selfish genes act to maintain accessory chromosomes during vegetative growth and may influence their spread via parasexual cycles. Finally, as Spok genes are mobilized by the newly described TE superfamily Starships, it suggests these TEs play crucial roles in forming accessory chromosomes and regions.

Our analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to AMF, FRE colonise plants during the winter season, when photosynthesis is more challenging. It is also noteworthy that FRE was unable to colonise the roots of spring-sown crops. The results of our laboratory pot experiments demonstrated that low temperatures are not sufficient for FRE colonisation. Furthermore, we observed that FRE, in contrast to AMF, exhibited increased colonisation in soils containing metabolically inactive plants.

Initial symptoms, included stem cankers, black lesions on sapwood and vascular tissue, discoloration and partial wilting of leaves, and eventual complete drying, leading to plant death. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the fungal pathogen causing wilt disease in C. sempervirens trees using morphological characterization and DNA sequencing. In 2022-2023, a disease survey was conducted in six districts of South Sumatra. The results showed that six out of ten locations were infected, with disease incidence ranging from 4.1% to 17.6% in 2022, increasing to 2% to 26.5% in 2023. Pathogen identification employed a polyphasic approach, combining morphological and molecular characteristics from specific genomic regions (the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and ?-tubulin). Both the morphological features (including a globose base with a long neck-ended tip with ostiolar hyphae, cylindrical conidia, and\u00a0hat-shaped ascospores) and phylogenetic analysis identified the isolates as Ceratocystis fimbriata. ITS gene sequences indicated that all the isolates belonged to the ITS5 haplotype. In pathogenicity test, pathogen caused mortality in C. sempervirens, Acacia mangium, and Artocarpus heterophyllus plants. The implications of these findings are significant, as they can potentially lead to the development of effective control measures.

Nanoparticles were synthesized under optimized conditions of cell-free culture filtrate (CFCF) concentration, substrate concentration, pH and temperature. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy confirmed an absorption peak between 200 and 400 nm, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the hexagonal crystal structure with an average size of 29 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis revealed a hydrodynamic size of 50.79 nm and a surface charge of \u221217.49 mV, indicating good stability. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis identified functional groups (C=O, N-O, and O-H) that are crucial for nanoparticles stabilization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis revealed spherical, rod-shaped and hexagonal nanoparticles with sizes between 12 and 41 nm.

Identification of Candida species and detection of antifungal resistance and virulence markers in C. albicans were carried out via Polymerase Chain Reaction. Thermal tolerance of C. albicans isolates was determined through microbial counts on specific parameters (63\u00b0C, 68\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C). Each experiment was replicated three times to ensure reliability. Post hoc analyses were performed to compare the observed differences. The prevalence of Candida albicans (15%), Candida parapsilosis (8%), Candida krusei (3%), Candida lusitaniae (2%) and Candida glabrata (1%) was revealed in 100 milk samples. C. albicans isolates exhibited significant virulence, antifungal resistance and biofilm\u2010producing properties.

However, the mechanisms by which laccases operate in these fungi remain under-researched. In this study, we identified two laccase-encoding genes, Mr-lac3 and Mr-lcc2, from Metarhizium robertsii, both of which are highly expressed during conidiation. Knocking out Mr-lac3 and Mr-lcc2 resulted in a significant increase in the conidial yields of M. robertsii. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of upstream regulators associated with the conidiation pathway were markedly up-regulated in \u0394Mr-lac3 and \u0394Mr-lcc2 compared to the wild-type strain during conidiation, indicating that Mr-lac3 and Mr-lcc2 negatively regulate conidia formation. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that Mr-lac3 and Mr-lcc2 are regulated by the pigment synthesis gene cluster, including Mr-Pks1, Mr-EthD, and Mlac1, and they also provide feedback regulation to jointly control pigment synthesis. Additionally, \u0394Mr-lac3 and \u0394Mr-lcc2 significantly reduced the trehalose content in conidia and increased the sensitivity to cell wall-perturbing agents, such as Congo red and guaiacol, which led to a marked decrease in tolerance to abiotic stresses.

Therefore, mushrooms have been exploited by humans for centuries for dietary or medical purposes. For example, the edible and medicinal mushrooms Hericium erinaceus and Pleurotus eryngii are grown commercially around the world. In nature, H. erinaceus grows on old or dead tree trunks, and P. eryngii grows on Apiaceae plant roots, whereas in cultivation, they grow on substrates mainly consisting of dry wood chips, straw, and cereals. To make their farming more sustainable, supplements such as olive mill solid waste (OMSW) have been added to support mushroom development. However, so far, the impact of substrate additives on the edible mushroom metabolic content has not been assessed. Methods Here, we examined the effect of different proportions of OMSW added to the substrate on the metabolic profiles of the fruiting body (FB) and mycelium of H. erinaceus and P. eryngii mushrooms. We used computational metabolomics strategies including GNPS molecular networking, MS2Query, and the FERMO dashboard, to organize, annotate, and prioritize metabolite features from the untargeted Q-Exactive Plus HR-LC-MS/MS metabolomics data. Following chromatography-based fractionation, the metabolite annotation of four metabolite features was further validated or fine-tuned using 1H-NMR, to resolve structural isomers. Results & Discussion Our computational metabolomics strategies showed several annotated metabolite features to be affected by OSMW concentration. In general, the methanolic extracts of H. erinaceus FB and mycelium were more highly enriched with specialized metabolites than those of P. eryngii. Interestingly, OMSW increased several hericenone analogues in the H. erinaceus FB, to which beneficial properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer and neuroprotective properties are assigned, as well as several erinacerin metabolites from the mycelium.

In this study, culture-independent ITS amplicon sequencing and culture-dependent isolation methods were used to reveal fungal community in roots of the turf-grass Zoysia japonica. A total of 317 OTUs were identified from root samples of Z. japonica by analysis of ITS amplicon reads. Fungal community was dominated by Sordariales (32.45%), followed by Chaetothyriales (18.16%), unknown taxa in Sordariomycetes (14.63%) and Pleosporales (12.48%). During isolation, 151 endophytic fungal strains were obtained from roots of Z. japonica and a variety of taxa were found by ITS amplification and sequencing. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungal species were further characterised in this study, based on morphological characterisation and multi-loci phylogenetic analysis, including Niesslia dimorphospora, a newly-recorded species in Korea and 10 novel species (Dactylaria hwasunensissp. nov., Lophiostoma jeollanense sp. nov., Magnaporthiopsis zoysiaesp. nov., Poaceascoma endophyticumsp. nov., P. koreanumsp. nov., P. magnumsp. nov., P. zoysiiradicicolasp. nov., Stagonospora endophytica sp. nov., Setophoma zoysiaesp. nov. and Pseudorhypophila poaesp. nov.).

This research area has garnered significant scientific interest due to its applicability in the biological and biomedical sectors. A central feature of yeast colony biofilm expansion is cellular demise, which is onset by one of two independent mechanisms: either accidental cell death (ACD) or regulated cell death (RCD). In this article, we generalise a recently developed continuum model for the nutrient-limited growth of a yeast colony biofilm to include the effects of ACD and RCD. This new model involves a system of four coupled nonlinear reaction\u2013diffusion equations for the yeast-cell density, the nutrient concentration, and two species of dead cells.

Although chemical nematicides have been effective in controlling nematodes, but their adverse environmental impact has urged to explore eco-friendly alternatives such as bioformulations. Trichoderma asperellum (Tr-9), an indigenous fungal bioagent isolated from elephant foot yam was effective against root-knot nematode under in-vitro conditions. Additionally, Nanma, a cassava-based biopesticide developed by ICAR-CTCRI, is commonly used to treat elephant foot yam tubers before planting to control diseases and nematode infestation. They can be combined with nematicides for effective nematode management while minimizing environmental risks. However, evaluating the compatibility of Trichoderma with nematicides is crucial before integrating both strategies for nematode management in tuber crops. In this context, the present study evaluated the compatibility of T. asperellum (Tr-9) with different concentrations of Carbofuran 3G (50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 ppm) and the Cassava-based biopesticide, Nanma (5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 ppm) using the poisoned food technique after a five-day incubation period under in-vitro conditions. Results revealed that Carbofuran 3G exhibited cent percent compatibility at 50 ppm, and with minimal inhibition (6.98%) observed at 100-200 ppm. Even at higher concentrations (400-800 ppm), only slight mycelial growth inhibition (15.25%-19.75%) was recorded, while at 1000 ppm, inhibition percentage increased to 36.30%. These findings indicate that all concentrations up to 800 ppm are highly compatible, while 1000 ppm remains moderately compatible with Carbofuran. In contrast, Nanma exhibited high incompatibility, inhibiting Trichoderma growth completely at concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 ppm. At even lower concentrations, inhibition percentage still remained high (70.32% - 78.55%). These findings indicated that Carbofuran 3G can be effectively integrated with T. asperellum (Tr-9) for nematode management in tuber crops, offering a balanced approach that combines chemical and biological methods while reducing environmental impact.

To this end, a tomato-cultivating experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, with the control group receiving no planting or irrigation (W0), during the years 2021 and 2022 in the Taiyuan region of Shanxi Province, China. The experiment incorporated three irrigation levels: W1 (50\u201370% of the field capacity), W2 (60\u201380% of the field capacity), and W3 (70\u201390% of the field capacity). The objective of our study was to clarify the effects of different irrigation levels on soil bacterial and fungal community compositions and functions, as well as tomato yield and water use efficiencies, by analyzing the changes in community structural characteristics and potential functional composition of soil bacteria and fungi under different irrigation levels. Our results showed that in comparison with the control treatment, the W3 irrigation treatment exhibited the highest bacterial \u03b1-diversity, while its fungal diversity was the lowest. The r-strategy microbial community in tomato soil demonstrated increased abundance under the irrigation treatment. The relative abundance of common beneficial tomato bacteria increased by 0.32\u20131.70%, but that of beneficial soil fungi decreased by 0.09\u20133.75%. Among the different irrigation treatments, the relative abundances of Bacillus and Plectosphaerella changed the most. The functional structure of the bacteria in the irrigation treatment remained largely unchanged, while the saprotroph functional group of fungi was increased by 14.72\u201323.28%. With the increase in irrigation volume, the tomato yield of the W3 treatment increased, though the water use efficiency was not the greatest. The W2 treatment did not significantly reduce the yield, but it did increase the pathotroph functional groups of fungi, which may reduce the stress resistance of plants to soil-borne diseases.

This study explores the potential of bioconverted fermented pangasius fish waste (FPW) produced through microbial fermentation as a poultry feed supplement.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, bioconversion of pangasius fish waste utilized a microbial consortium (PaRmYl: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhizopus microsporus, and Yarrowia lipolytica) at varying inoculum doses (5%, 10%, and 20%) and fermentation durations (2, 4, and 8 days).

Subsequently, the impacts of different temperatures on microbial biomass and community structure were revealed by quantitative real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing, and the biomarkers at different fermentation temperatures were identified by LEfSe analysis. Finally, the functional potential of microbes was predicted by correlation analysis.The bacterial biomass increased initially and peaked at 8.4 \u00d7 109 copies/g at 35\u00b0C, then decreased as the temperature rose. The fungal biomass exhibited a downward trend with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum of 3.9 \u00d7 106 copies/g at 30\u00b0C. When the fermentation temperature exceeded 45\u00b0C, the growth of both bacteria and fungi was significantly restricted. Amplicon sequencing results indicated that Staphylococcus and Aspergillus genera dominated the bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. As the temperature increased, the relative abundance of Staphylococcus decreased first and then increased (46.1%\u201398.5%), while that of Aspergillus increased first and then decreased (34.9%\u201377.4%). Additionally, correlation analysis suggested that microbial communities shaped by different temperatures were responsible for the differences in physicochemical metabolites of cigar leaves. The biomarkers identified in the low-temperature fermentation group, including Staphylococcus, Stemphylium, Sampaiozyma, and Filobasidium, were likely responsible for the production of flavor metabolites, the accumulation of sugars, and the elevated ratio of potassium ions to chloride ions contents.

Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and variance partitioning were used to identify the soil properties that significantly influence pathogenic fungi community compositions within the three sites in a yam production zone. The results have shown that despite the fact that the three sites exhibited contrasted soils grouped in two types according to physicochemical parameters, four ubiquitous genera including Fusarium, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Trichoderma were identified within pathogenic fungi communities in yam field soils, with Fusarium as the most dominant core genus.

Endohyphal bacterial symbionts are known to affect fungal pathogenicity, secondary metabolite production, and adaptability, yet many aspects of their diversity and interactions remain uncertain. In contrast, endohyphal viruses, despite their widespread presence, are poorly understood in terms of their diversity, ecological roles, and evolutionary relationships with fungal hosts. These gaps highlight the need for integrative studies to explore the composition, diversity, host associations, and functional roles of both bacterial and viral communities in fungi. This study aimed to (1) characterize the diversity of endohyphal bacterial and viral communities within selected fungal endophytes using genomic and transcriptomic approaches, and (2) test for host specialization through phylogenetic signals and core microbial taxa. Results Endohyphal microbial communities from 19 fungal isolates from eight fungal orders (Amphisphaeriales, Botryosphaeriales, Diaporthales, Glomerellales, Mucorales, Pleosporales, Sordariales, and Xylariales) obtained from Fagus grandifolia leaves were characterized. Bacterial communities exhibited high diversity and significant phylogenetic signals, with core taxa such as Bacillales, Burkholderiales, Enterobacterales, Hyphomicrobiales, and Pseudomonadales, shared across all fungal samples. Specific bacterial taxa displayed potential host specialization, including Moraxellales, Sphingomonadales, and Streptosporangiaceae for Amphisphaeriales fungal samples; Enterobacterales (e.g., Enterobacteraceae), Hyphomicrobiales (e.g., Rhizobiaceae), and Micrococcales for Glomerellales; and Cytophagales for Diaporthales. Viral communities were less diverse, with Bamfordvirae and Heunggongvirae (double-stranded DNA viruses) identified as core taxa in metagenomic data, while metatranscriptomic data revealed no core taxa. Surprisingly, only a few reads of double-stranded RNA mycoviruses were detected. Conclusions The findings suggest a level of host specialization in bacterial communities and a more complex, limited association for viral communities, with dsDNA dominating the endohyphal virome. This study enhances our understanding of fungal-microbe interactions and highlights the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of endohyphal microbiota. Future efforts to expand reference databases and investigate the functional roles of these microbial taxa will further elucidate their contributions to fungal biology, impacts on their plant hosts, and ecosystem processes.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-11", "authors": [{"authorId": "1438879300", "name": "E.

Although traditionally produced using lactic acid bacteria, yeasts offer significant advantages, such as higher tolerance to acidic environments, a broader substrate range, and the potential for genetic and metabolic engineering. This review explores the potential use of Lachancea thermotolerans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida utilis, and Pichia kudriavzevii as LA producers, highlighting their unique characteristics and industrial applications. S. cerevisiae stands out due to its robust genetic toolkit and acid tolerance, while K. marxianus offers thermotolerance and the efficient utilization of lactose and pentoses, making it ideal for high-temperature fermentations. K. lactis is particularly suited for valorizing dairy by-products like whey, P. kudriavzevii exhibits high tolerance to multiple stresses, while C. utilis demonstrates superior resilience to lignocellulosic inhibitors, enabling its use in biorefineries. Key challenges, including enhancing LA tolerance and optimizing metabolic pathways, are addressed through strategies like heterologous lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression, redox balance modification, and adaptive laboratory evolution. The review also discusses industrial applications, particularly in the context of circular economy approaches, where yeasts can convert waste streams into high-value LA.

The evaluation of soil health relies heavily on physicochemical indicators. However, it remains unclear whether and how microbial traits are related to soil health in soil with long-term organic manure amendment. This study aims to examine how detrimental and beneficial microbial traits change with soil health based on physicochemical indicators. This research measures the effects of 9-year manure supplementation on soil health using multiomics techniques. We found that, compared to 100% chemical fertilizers, the soil health index increased by 5.2%, 19.3%, and 72.6% with 25%, 50%, and 100% organic fertilizer amendments, respectively. Correspondingly, the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, including Actinomadura, Actinoplanes, Aeromicrobium, Agromyces, Azospira, Cryobacterium, Dactylosporangium, Devosia, Hyphomicrobium, Kribbella, and Lentzea, increased progressively, while the abundance of the pathogenic fungus Fusarium decreased with the organic manure application rate. In addition, the application of organic manure significantly increased the concentrations of soil metabolites, such as sugars (raffinose, trehalose, maltose, and maltotriose) and lithocholic acid, which promoted plant growth and soil aggregation. Moreover, the abundances of pathogens and beneficial microorganisms and the concentrations of beneficial soil metabolites were significantly correlated with the soil health index based on physicochemical indicators. We conclude that organic fertilizer can enhance soil health by promoting the increase in beneficial microorganisms while suppressing detrimental microorganisms, which can serve as potential indicators for assessing soil health.

We analyzed changes in the rhizosphere soil fungal communities using ITS sequencing. The results revealed that different plants affected the properties of the rhizosphere soil. The contents of organic matter, total nitrogen, and total potassium in the rhizosphere soil exhibited significant variations compared to the soil that was not occupied by plants. Soil fungal composition analysis revealed that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla in the soil of this mining area. At the genus level, compared to the mineral soil without plants, the proportion of Epicoccum increased in the rhizosphere soils of different plants, while the proportion of Fusarium decreased. Alpha diversity studies revealed that fungal diversity in the rhizospheres of different plants changed significantly. Beta diversity studies showed a significant differentiation in the fungal community structure of different plant rhizosphere soils compared to the KB group. The FunGuild predictions indicated that different plant rhizosphere soils are enriched with different guilds and trophic patterns of fungi. In addition, we found that soil physical and chemical properties were significantly correlated with the abundance and diversity of fungal communities.

Saproxylic beetles locate suitable substrates mainly through visual cues and via olfactory cues emitted by deadwood, other insects and fungi.\nFor the conservation of saproxylic beetles, it is essential to understand which abiotic and biotic factors most significantly influence their habitat requirements when locating suitable substrates.\nIn a field experiment, in sunny and shaded plots, we exposed 400 bundles of freshly cut deadwood, each consisting of three logs with a combination of different tree species and treatments (i.e., fungi inoculation), mimicking biotic interactions. We sampled arriving saproxylic beetles via sticky traps directly applied on deadwood to evaluate the effect of sun exposure and the biotic interactions on arriving saproxylic beetles.\nWe found higher species numbers and abundance of saproxylic beetles under shaded than sunny conditions, but we detected no effect on the standardised number of species (diversity).

Treatments (fungi inoculation, sterilisation and burning) did not affect the arriving saproxylic beetles.\nOur results suggest that saproxylic beetles' attraction to freshly cut deadwood is mainly driven by sun exposure rather than biotic interactions, despite assumed close associations between beetles and fungi.

Most studies of climate forces and plant biodiversity effects on microbiome consider the perturbations and the microbial functional groups in isolation preventing us from understanding the full picture of the relative and differential impacts of perturbations on microbial functional groups.We measured changes in multiple microbial communities with different functionality, including plant mutualists and pathogens, after three growing seasons in a full-factorial experiment manipulating precipitation (50%, 150% of ambient), plant diversity, and plant composition. Using amplicon sequencing to characterize the response of fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria and oomycetes, and we found that composition of all microbial groups differentiated strongly between precipitation treatments.Oomycete and bacterial diversity increased with 150% precipitation, while AM and saprotroph fungal diversity decreased. Microbial differentiation in response to plant family and plant species composition was stronger after the third growing season than observed after year one. However, microbial response to plant species richness was weaker in year three. Microbiome response to plant composition was largely independent of the response to precipitation, except for oomycetes, which had greater response to plant composition in high precipitation.These findings build upon prior findings that these microbial community members differentially respond to plant community compositional treatments, by measuring the response over 3 years and with the addition of precipitation treatments.

Using an evolve and re-sequence approach, we found that serial passaging of the cross-kingdom fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum through tomato plants or axenic media rapidly increased fitness under the selection condition. TE insertions were the predominant type of mutations in the evolved lines, with a single non-autonomous hAT-type TE accounting for 63% of total events detected. TEs inserted preferentially at sites of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, a hallmark of ARs.

Eighteen samples of maize (6), rice (6), and sorghum (6) from markets and stores were analyzed for fungi profiling and Aflatoxins using the conventional method of identification and Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) method respectively. Forty-one fungi species were isolated in maize, 36 in rice, and 26 in sorghum. Rice samples collected from the markets had the highest mean fungal load of (12.47 \u00b1 10.01) x 10\u2074 CFU/g while sorghum samples from the market had the lowest fungal load of (2.03 \u00b1 1.27) x 10\u2074 CFU/g. The predominant genera isolated were Aspergillus sp, Fusarium, and Penicillium sp. Aspergillus flavus (14.63%) and Aspergillus tamarii (14.63%) were the most prevalent species in maize. Aspergillus niger (13.88 %) and Aspergillus flavus (11.11 %) were predominant in rice. Fusarium solani (19.23%) and Fusarium oxysporum (13.79 %) were more prevalent in sorghum. Aflatoxins analysis revealed that 16.66% and 27.77 % of the samples exceeded the 2 \u00b5g/Kg and 4 \u00b5g/Kg EU maximum regulatory limit for AFB1 and total aflatoxins, respectively, in all cereals intended for direct human consumption.

Its half-maximal inhibitory concentration for hyphal growth was 175.6 mg L\u22121. Apple fruit were immersed in UA solution, followed by inoculation with P. expansum, to measure their disease response. The results demonstrated that UA induced significant disease resistance in apple fruit and that its mechanisms are multifaceted and associated with defensive and antioxidative enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Chitinase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase were activated and maintained at relatively high levels. The activities of enzymes and their metabolites in the phenylpropanoid pathway, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase were significantly increased; accordingly, total phenolics, flavonoid, and lignin contents were significantly increased. The activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were enhanced upon UA treatment, while catalase activity was suppressed, which regulates hydrogen peroxide accumulation to defend against pathogens.

This study aimed to identify bacteria and fungi inhabiting Western house martin droppings Elele to bridge the gap in our understanding of their microbial ecology. Droppings were collected from birds whose nesting sites are in Elele which were labeled: Site A, Site B, Site C, Site D, Site E, Site F and Site G. Samples are collected by easy-to-build box which is made up of a plastic box, a plastic tray and a Sterile gauze. for a noninvasive fecal collection method, droppings were collected into a sterile universal container and was analyzed using culture-based method. Bacteria were isolated and identified through colonial morphology, gram staining, biochemical tests such as catalase, indole, urease, citrate test etc. Fungal isolates were identified based on morphology, microscopic examination. A total of twenty-one (21) sample was collected and cultured yielding nine 9(42.9%) positive results for both bacteria and fungi. Results revealed a diverse microbial community in Western house martin dungs, encompassing bacterial genera such as Salmonella spp 5(55.5%), Escherichia spp 2(22.2%), Campylobacter spp 2(22.2%) and fungal species including Aspergillus spp 3(33.3%), Candida spp 3(33.3%), Mucor spp 2(22.2%), Chrysosporium spp 1(11.1) with a P value <0.05 which was considered not significant, meaning deviation from the null hypothesis is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.

Herein, we conduct a novel consolidation of research from the Arequipa region of southern Peru that integrates university theses written in Spanish alongside peer-reviewed journal articles. The objective is to provide a place-based complement to existing research in English scientific journals focused on effective tools for Cr treatment from tannery wastewater. Our consolidation categorized a total of 75 publications (70 theses and five peer-reviewed) into five distinct strategies for Cr treatment: adsorption (twenty-three studies), phytoremediation (eighteen studies), bioremediation (thirteen studies), electrocoagulation (five studies), and other techniques (fifteen studies). This synthesis highlighted potentially promising approaches that could be sustainably tailored to regional resources and waste products. This includes sorptive materials derived from food waste such as native achiote peels (B. orellana) and avocado seeds (P. americana) either used directly or as a feedstock for biochar. Other technologies include phytoremediation using microalgae and resident vascular plants and microbial bioremediation that capitalizes on indigenous bacteria and fungi. Promise was also discerned in studies that incorporated a combination of abiotic and biotic mechanisms tailored toward the region, such as infiltration using selective and bioactive materials, wetlands, solar distillation, iron-based coagulation and flocculation, and bioreactors. These findings provide a sustainable complement to prior global investigations for effective attenuation strategies by adding novel materials and techniques that could be further explored to assess the viability of implementation at pilot and larger scales.

However, the accumulated studies testify that plants are not living alone in nature. The current paradigm in plant science explains a plant as a holobiont (plant and interacting microorganisms), instead of a single organism. In the center of this new paradigm, there is a symbiosis between plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). About 80% of terrestrial plant species form mutualism with AMF that act as an extension of roots. The symbiosis is crucial for plant nutrient uptake from the soil as well as resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. Although the symbiosis is crucial for plant physiology and ecology, the efforts for summarizing current understanding and formulating it for teaching are relatively poor. For efficient introduction in class, it is important to visualize the AMF living inside roots. However, the widely used methodology for staining requires a carcinogenic chemical. Based on the current state of knowledge in AMF biology, I introduce AMF and a safer methodology for visualizing AMF in plants.

We assessed the impact of plastic leachate on marine microbial communities in vitro by exposure to one of four plastic leachates (from linear low-density polyethylene [LLPDE], polyamide-6 [or polycaprolactam; PA6], polyethylene terephthalate [PET] and polylactic acid [PLA]), prepared by immersing plastics in artificial seawater salts broth for three months at 80 \u00b0C. Microbial communities were then exposed to different leachates, noting that lower concentrations of plastic additives leached from the more inert plastic types (LLDPE and PET), as determined by GC-MS. PLA-leachate exposed communities differed significantly in composition from other plastic-leachate-exposed communities (PERMANOVA, P=0.001) as assessed by 16S rRNA gene and ITS region amplicon sequencing. Communities exposed to PLA-leachate contained a higher proportion of Proteobacteria, specifically Halomonas spp., previously reported to degrade LDPE and common plasticisers. Greater relative abundances of Psathyrellaceae fungi also distinguished these communities from those exposed to other plastic leachates. However, despite significant differences in the structure of communities exposed to PLA-leachate, we found no difference in the relative abundances of gene transcripts associated with plastic degradation.

This study evaluated phytochemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial potential of ethanolic and methanolic leaf extracts of orange (Citrus sinensis) and mango (Mangifera indica) against Didymella bryoniae, the causal agent of gummy stem blight in watermelon and cucumber. Leaf extracts were prepared using Soxhlet extraction with methanol and water as solvents, and the agar well diffusion method was employed for the susceptibility assay. Preliminary fungal identification was based on conidial and colony morphology, Pathogenicity was conducted on fresh test plants to ensure the organism caused the disease. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, carbohydrates, steroids, and alkaloids in both extracts, with orange leaf extract exhibiting a high concentration of alkaloids and cardiac glycosides (+++).

While considerable research has focused on belowground systems, the phyllosphere microbiome remains underexplored, particularly regarding its functional responses to pathogen infection. In this study, we investigated the phyllosphere microbiome dynamics of crabapple (Malus \u2018Kelsey\u2019) infected by Gymnosporangium yamadae using metatranscriptomic sequencing across six stages of rust disease progression. Our analysis revealed a general increase in the diversity of fungi, bacteria and viruses in infected leaves. Notably, fungal diversity negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, reflecting competitive interactions during disease development. Microbial taxa in diseased leaves exhibited heightened expression activity compared to healthy leaves, with fungi progressively dominating the microbial community. Functional co-occurrence networks of the phyllosphere microbiome in infected leaves were more complex than in healthy leaves, suggesting adaptive reorganization in response to pathogen invasion. Differentially expressed genes at each stage were significantly enriched in carbohydrate metabolism pathways and gene regulation-related functions, enabling functional adaptations to rust diseases. Random forest modeling identified key microbial transcripts associated with pathogen abundance, including beneficial microbes like Saitozyma podzolica, which secretes glucan-degrading enzymes, and Mortierella elongata, involved in sterol biosynthesis and plant resistance. Conversely, Alternaria alternata emerged as a major pathobiome contributor, secreting enzymes that degrade plant cell wall components (e.g., pectin, cellulose, lignin, and xylan), and engaging in MAPK signaling pathways critical for pathogenesis. Our findings underscore the vital role of the phyllosphere microbiome in mediating plant-pathogen interactions and shaping disease progression, providing a foundation for microbiome-based strategies to enhance plant resilience. Importance Our findings reveal the dynamic shifts in the expression patterns and adaptive functional strategies of crabapple phyllosphere microbiome in response to the Gymnosporangium yamadae infection.

To identify potential TKC-related genes on a donor chromosome, a genome-wide screening of TKC-deficient mutants was performed using a comprehensive collection of Escherichia coli gene knockout mutants (Keio collection) as donors and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as a recipient.

This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions.

Water dynamics are rarely mentioned in standard biology discussions, even though biomolecules are strongly influenced by the hydration shells around them. For water to affiliate with all things living requires specialized entry and exiting of water, achievable by a ubiquitous channel protein called an aquaporin. In this article, we will explore water\u2019s often neglected complex relationship with all things biological from an aquaporin perspective. The aquaporin family of proteins is ancient and spans the tree of life in archaea, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, animals, and viruses. From DNA to osmoregulation, aquaporins literally channel the water molecule through geological time. We will also explore the bigger picture of the aquaporin as a teaching tool for evolution.

Seeds carrying F. verticillioides are unsuitable for storage and pose a serious threat to human and animal health due to the toxins released by the fungus. Previously, the candidate gene ZmC2GnT was identified, using linkage and association analysis, as potentially implicated in maize seed resistance to F. verticillioides; however, its disease resistance mechanism remained unknown. Our current study revealed that ZmC2GnT codes an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, using sequence structure and evolutionary analysis. The candidate gene association analysis revealed multiple SNPs located in the UTRs and introns of ZmC2GnT. Cloning and comparing ZmC2GnT showed variations in the promoter and CDS of resistant and susceptible materials. The promoter of ZmC2GnT in the resistant parent contains one extra cis-element ABRE associated with the ABA signal, compared to the susceptible parent. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of ZmC2GnT in the resistant parent matches that of B73, but the susceptible parent contains ten amino acid alterations. The resistant material BT-1 and the susceptible material N6 were used as parents to observe the expression level of the ZmC2GnT. The results revealed that the expression of ZmC2GnT in disease-resistant maize seeds was significantly up-regulated after infection with F. verticillioides. After treatment with F. verticillioides or ABA, the expression activity of the ZmC2GnT promoter increased significantly in the resistant material, but no discernible difference was detected in the susceptible material. When ZmC2GnT from resistant and susceptible materials was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, the seeds\u2019 resistance to F. verticillioides increased, although there was no significant difference between the two types of overexpressed plants. Our study revealed that ZmC2GnT could participate in the immune process of plants against pathogenic fungus.

However, the distribution patterns of microorganisms along elevation gradients have not yet been clarified, in particular when associated with strong changes in dominant species. Five typical vegetation types (i.e., coniferous forests, meadow grasslands, alpine shrubs, alpine meadows, and sparse vegetation of limestone flats) from contrasting vegetation belts were selected to explore the influence of elevation gradients on soil microbial communities. The results showed that Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the prevalent fungal phyla. Soil bacterial alpha diversity increased with increasing elevation, while soil fungal alpha diversity showed an obvious mid-elevation pattern. The beta diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities reflected a clear spatial niche-differentiation, and indicated that herbaceous plants affected soil bacterial communities while shrubs preferred soil fungal communities.

Cadmium (Cd) toxicity inhibits fungal growth and leads to Cd accumulation in the mycelium. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Cd-induced growth inhibition and Cd accumulation remain poorly understood. Here, S. commune 20R-7-F01 was cultured in Cd-supplemented minimal medium (MM) to investigate the response of S. commune 20R-7-F01 to Cd exposure. We found that Cd exposure resulted in growth inhibition and a Cd-dependent increase in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO production was primarily mediated by the nitrate reductase (NR) pathway. Cd-induced growth inhibition was alleviated by inhibiting NR activity or scavenging NO, highlighting the role of NO in stress responses. Furthermore, NO was found to enhance chitinase activity, thereby promoting Cd accumulation in the fungal cell wall and leading to growth inhibition. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which S. commune copes with Cd stress.

Tree leaves and rhizosphere are primary sites for matter and energy exchange, functioning as key assimilation organs that forests provide for ecological services. The introduction of functional species alters soil properties, which, in turn, directly or indirectly shape leaf functional traits, soil microbial dynamics, and their association. However, the correlation between aboveground functional traits and belowground rhizosphere soil microorganisms of dominant tree species in mixed leguminous and non-leguminous forests remains unclear. In this study, the responses and correlations of leaf functional traits and rhizosphere soil microbial communities of Castanopsis hystrix Hook. f. & Thomson ex A. DC. across three forest types were investigated. A pure forest (PF) of C. hystrix was designated as control forest, while a leguminous mixed forest (LMF) consisting of C. hystrix and the leguminous species Acacia mangium Willd. as well as a non-leguminous mixed forest (NMF) comprising C. hystrix and the non-leguminous species Schima superba Gardner & Champ. served as experimental forests. Seven leaf functional trait indices were measured, and the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities was included in the analysis. The results were as follows: Firstly, compared to the pure forest, the specific leaf area (SLA) of C. hystrix significantly decreased in both mixed forest types (p < 0.05). Additionally, in comparison to the pure forest, the leaf area (LA) and leaf organic carbon content (LOC) of C. hystrix significantly reduced (p < 0.05), whereas the leaf total phosphorus content (LTP) significantly increased in the non-leguminous tree species mixed forest (p < 0.01). The leaf dry matter content (LDMC), relative chlorophyll content (RCC), and leaf total nitrogen content (LTN) of C. hystrix exhibited no significant differences among the three forest types (p > 0.05). Secondly, neither the dominant phyla of rhizosphere soil microorganisms nor the bacterial richness and diversity had differences in the mixed forests. However, the richness and diversity of rhizosphere soil fungi significantly increased in the mixed forests, and those in the leguminous mixed forest exhibited more positive effects compared to those in the non-leguminous mixed forest. Finally, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed significant correlations between plant leaf functional traits and rhizosphere soil microorganisms. Specifically, LDMC, SLA, LTN, and LTP of C. hystrix showed significant correlations with differences in the structure of bacterial community (p < 0.05), and LTN was significantly correlated with differences in the structure of the fungal community (p < 0.05). In summary, we found that plant leaf functional traits and the community of rhizosphere soil microorganisms displayed significant differences in the mixed forests, and those mixed with leguminous trees may further enhance the assimilation processes by modifying the utilization of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus by plants and microorganisms. Meanwhile, our results support the interaction of physiological and ecological processes between the aboveground and belowground parts of C. hystrix. These findings emphasize the important roles of N2-fixing leguminous trees and synergy of aboveground\u2013belowground processes in establishing sustainable artificial forests.", "venue": "Forests", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-18", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346191868", "name": "Yufen Wu"}, {"authorId": "2346147471", "name": "Shihong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2346150592", "name": "Genglin Xie"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Yanqing Shao"}, {"authorId": "2346273509", "name": "Shi Shi"}, {"authorId": "2346251320", "name": "Jieyu Lin"}, {"authorId": "2287183360", "name": "Qinggong Mao"}, {"authorId": "2346255250", "name": "Yuling Li"}]}, {"paperId": "ab71ee420312e8b6ba46563656a6a4e32a0f7826", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.14719/pst.3017", "CorpusId": 276143648}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab71ee420312e8b6ba46563656a6a4e32a0f7826", "title": "Antifungal activity of ethanol and methanol extracts from Ageratum conyzoides L. against Fusarium oxysporum", "abstract": "Billygoat weed (Ageratum conyzoides L.) is generally distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of various extracts from the billygoat weed on the antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, a fungus that causes diseases for many crops. The billygoat weed powder was extracted with 2 solvents, ethanol and methanol at 4 concentrations (30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 %) and the antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by measuring the inhibition of fungal growth diameter at different extract concentrations (0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 4 % and 8 %). The results demonstrate that the E90 and M90 extracts, at a concentration of 8 %, exhibit better antifungal activity compared to the other extracts at the same concentration, with inhibition rates of 87.21 % and 89.77 % respectively.

Because of potential effects on crop productivity, the toxic effects of heavy metals (HMs) in Trichoderma are of interest. However, there have been few studies on the biochemical and molecular response to oxidation caused by exposure to copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) and whether this antioxidant response is species-specific. In this study, we compared the tolerance of Trichoderma asperellum and Trichoderma longibrachiatum to Cu, Pb, and Cr and evaluated the expression of genes related to the antioxidant response, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and cysteine synthase (CYS) as well as the activity of peroxidase and catalase. The isolates of Trichoderma were selected because we previously reported them as promotors of plant growth and agents of biological control. Our results revealed that, with exposure to the three HMs, the Trichoderma cultures formed aggregates and the culture color changed according to the metal and the Trichoderma species. The tolerance index (TI) indicated that the two Trichoderma species were tolerant of HMs (Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Cr\u00a0>\u00a0Pb). However, the TI and conidia production revealed that T. longibrachiatum was more tolerant of HMs than T. asperellum. The three HMs caused oxidative damage in both Trichoderma species, but the enzyme activity and gene expression were differentially regulated based on exposure time (72 and 144\u00a0h) to the HMs and Trichoderma species. The main changes occurred in T. asperellum; the maximum expression of the GPX gene occurred at 144\u00a0h in response to all three HMs, whereas the CAT gene was upregulated at 72 h in response to Cu but downregulated at 144 h in response to all three HMs. The CYS gene was upregulated in response to the three metals. The peroxidase activity increased with all three HMs, but the catalase activity increased with Cu and Pb at 72 h and decreased at 144 h with Pb and Cr. In T.\u00a0longibrachiatum, the GPX gene was upregulated with all three HMs at 72\u00a0h, the CAT gene was upregulated only with Pb at 72 h and was downregulated at 144 h with HMs. Cr and Cu upregulated CYS gene expression, but expression did not change with Pb. The peroxidase activity increased with Cu at 144\u00a0h and with Cr at 72 h, whereas Pb decreased the enzyme activity. In contrast, catalase activity increased with the three metals at 144 h. In conclusion, T. longibrachiatum was more tolerant of Cu, Cr, and Pb than was T. asperellum, but exposure to all three HMs caused oxidative damage to both Trichoderma species. Peroxidases and catalases were activated, and the expression of the genes GPX and CYS was upregulated, whereas the CAT gene was downregulated. These findings indicate that the antioxidant response to HMs was genetically modulated in each Trichoderma species.", "venue": "PeerJ", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "1414152050", "name": "D.

Seagrasses, as globally distributed marine flowering plants, have critical ecological functions, but knowledge about their associated fungal communities remains relatively limited. Previous amplicon surveys of the fungal community associated with the seagrass, Zostera marina have revealed an abundance of potentially novel chytrids. In this study, we employed deep metagenomic sequencing to extract metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from these chytrids and other microbial eukaryotes associated with Z. marina leaves. Our efforts resulted in the recovery of five eukaryotic MAGs, including a single fungal MAG in the order Loubulomycetales (65% BUSCO completeness), three MAGs representing diatoms in the family Bacillariaceae (93%, 70% and 31% BUSCO completeness) and a single MAG representing a haptophyte algae in the genus Prymnesium (40% BUSCO completeness). Whole-genome phylogenomic assessment of these MAGs suggests they all largely represent under sequenced, and possibly novel eukaryotic lineages. Of particular interest, the chytrid MAG was placed within the order Lobulomycetales, consistent with the identity of the dominant chytrid from previous Z. marina amplicon survey results. Annotation of this MAG yielded 5,650 gene models of which 77% shared homology to current databases. With-in these gene models, we predicted 121 carbohydrate-active enzymes and 393 secreted proteins (103 cytoplasmic effectors, 30 apoplastic effectors). Exploration of orthologs between the Lobulomycetales MAG and existing Chytridiomycota genomes have revealed a landscape of high-copy gene families related to host recognition and interaction. Further machine learning analyses based on carbohydrate-active enzyme composition predict that this MAG is a symbiont.

Integrating rice cultivation with the edible mushroom Stropharia rugosoannulata further improves soil fertility and enhances organic carbon sequestration. This rotation introduces organic matter into the soil, affecting microbial community structure and supporting the decomposition of complex organic materials via lignocellulose-decomposing fungi. These processes contribute to soil organic carbon accumulation, nutrient cycling, and long-term soil health. The study emphasizes the importance of microbial communities (including live biomass and necromass) in maintaining ecosystem stability and highlights the potential of the rice\u2013S. rugosoannulata rotation model as a sustainable agricultural practice. Further research is needed to clarify how fungal necromass contributes to soil carbon accumulation and to optimize agricultural practices for improving soil health and carbon sequestration in response to climate change.

The study was carried out on the ecosystem dendrological territory of the Siberian Botanical Garden of the Tomsk State University in 2020\u20132023. When conducting the study, generally accepted methods were used: N.A. Naumova, I.N. Beideman, G.N. Zaitsev, B.A. Dospehov. The objects of the study were three samples of Allium altaicum Pall. The seeds were obtained from the botanical gardens of Ivanovo, Norway and Germany. Collection samples are 2\u20134 years old. Samples of A. altaicum show high seed germination in the year of harvesting \u2013 from 93.5 to 96.7 %. All samples make self-seeding, which indicates adaptation of the species upon introduction. When propagating A. altaicum from seeds, it is recommended to use seeds no older than 1 year of storage. Under the conditions of the Tomsk Region, A. altaicum samples undergo a full development cycle. The growing season ranges from 156 to 160 days. The studied samples are promising for use for cutting greenery in early spring and autumn. High seed productivity and seed germination were revealed. Fungal species (Aspergillus, Penicillium, Stachybotrys) found on the seeds are capable of producing toxins and inhibiting the germination of onion seeds.

Here, we investigate the impact of microsporidia infection on host lipid metabolism using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans along with its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. We show that infection causes an increase in the level of C. elegans lipid droplet associated lipase, ATGL-1, and a decrease in host fat levels. A mutation that decreases ATGL-1 activity and overexpression of ATGL-1 did not significantly change N. parisii infection levels. Using lipidomics we show that N. parisii infection decreases C. elegans triglyceride levels and results in increased ceramides that we speculate are synthesized by N. parisii. Mutations in host genes involved in ceramide synthesis did not significantly change the levels of N. parisii infection.

Fairy rings occur when fungi grow radially in the soil, raising from a central point, progressively degrading organic matter and thus affecting vegetation. The observation of such spatial patterns allows mycologists to conduct an in-depth analysis of the role of fungi in ecosystems.\n This review presents the current knowledge and scientific advancement of the studies of FFRs. An historical appraisal from the most representative pioneer studies until recent works is presented in different scientific fields, including microbiology, chemistry, botany and ecology. Based on a deep analysis of bibliographic data, we synopsised different aspects of FFRs: i) history of studies, ii) taxonomy, iii) ecology (environmental conditions and biogeography), iv) classification of vegetation patterns, v) spatial dynamics, vi) role as ecosystem engineer (impact on soil chemistry, plants and microbiota).\n In conclusion, beside still open research areas requiring further investigation, a schematic functional model of fungal fairy rings is proposed, in which on one hand the dynamics of the fungal mycelium is explained by self-DNA accumulation and the build-up of autotoxicity. On the other hand, the effects of fungi on plants are related to the intermingled and differently spatially distributed effects of hydrophobicity, phytotoxicity and phytostimulation.", "venue": "IMA Fungus", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-17", "authors": [{"authorId": "2325142280", "name": "M.

In Europe, effective management of this pest requires comprehensive regulatory and monitoring strategies, including the annual collection of thousands of wood samples from symptomatic trees and their surroundings, inspection of wood packaging materials like pallets, and the trapping of the insect vector, Monochamus spp., through national networks. Insects and wood samples are sent to official laboratories, where the latter are sometimes incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 15 days, aiming to maximize the probability of the detection of the nematode. This study expected to elucidate the effect of the wood incubation process on the detection of B. xylophilus by analyzing wood samples from pallets and green wood obtained from pine stands, both harbouring nematodes in adult and juvenile stages. Additionally, the investigation sought to assess how the presence of fungi, which serve as a food source for the nematodes, enables B. xylophilus to persist in treated pallet wood that is colonized by these fungi. The results indicated that the incubation period is unnecessary for detecting B. xylophilus in pallets, except when the wood is heavily colonized by fungi providing suitable nutrition for the nematodes, although such occurrences are expected to be rare. Furthermore, this study found no significant differences in population growth between the two stages of the nematode\u2019s life cycle. This suggests that second-stage juveniles present in wood samples, despite not undergoing sexual differentiation, do not hinder the reproductive capacity of B. xylophilus. The risk of a potential infestation in treated pallet wood is unlikely if the treatment has been performed correctly, and the incubation does not contribute to increasing the probability of detecting the PWN. Conversely, for samples obtained from trees, the incubation period significantly enhances nematode detection.", "venue": "Forests", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-14", "authors": [{"authorId": "12701316", "name": "M.

However, until now, a comprehensive description of its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has been lacking. In our current study, we have successfully assembled and analysed the mitogenomes of five Strobilomyces species. These mitogenomes span a range from 35,618 base pairs (bp) to 42,088 bp, exhibiting a higher nucleotide abundance of AT compared to GC. All five mitogenomes harbour 14 conserved protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 24 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Notably, the overall ratio of Ka/Ks for all PCGs was found to be less than 1.0, indicating that these genes have undergone purifying selection during evolution. Intriguingly, the mitogenomic comparison revealed two instances of gene re-arrangement, which were directly linked to the geographical distribution of the Strobilomyces species. The concatenated mitochondrial PCGs (mtPCGs) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) phylogenies displayed a robust congruent topology at the family level. Specifically, the Strobilomyces species clustered together and formed sister relationship with other Boletaceae species in the mtPCGs tree. In contrast, the Strobilomyces species grouped at the base of the nrDNA tree when concerning Boletaceae.

Seed carriage has emerged as a major route for the dissemination of soybean diseases. In this study, 14 soybean cultivars from three northeastern provinces were collected and examined for seed-borne microorganisms using traditional detection technology and high-throughput sequencing technology. Through traditional detection techniques, a total of six genera of bacteria and seventeen genera of fungi were isolated from the test varieties. The quantity and types of microorganisms on the seed surface were greater than those on the seed coat and within the seed, while the seed coat and internal seed contained fewer microorganisms. The dominant fungal genera were Cladosporium, Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria, accounting for 21.23%, 17.45%, 15.57%, and 11.56% of the genera, respectively. The dominant bacterial genera were Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, and Pantoea, accounting for 37.46%, 17.29%, and 15.27% of the genera, respectively. The dominant genera obtained through traditional seed-carrying assay techniques were also dominant in high-throughput sequencing. However, some dominant genera obtained through high-throughput sequencing were not isolated by traditional methods. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that soybean seeds from Jilin Province had the highest abundance of seed-borne fungi, followed by seeds from Liaoning Province and Heilongjiang Province. Jilin Province also had the highest abundance of seed-borne bacteria, followed by Heilongjiang Province and Liaoning Province.

The convenience and pervasiveness of these come at a high cost with adverse effects on human health and our planet\u2019s ecosystems as they are not biodegradable. It is pivotal that an alternative and sustainable solution is found to address this problem. Mycelium-based biocomposites, made up of root-like networks called hyphae are sought out as a potential substitute for plastic-based foams as they are biodegradable. They employ a waste-to-value strategy by using agricultural wastes as a growing media for the mycelium. The study primarily focuses on the comparative analysis of mycelium-based biocomposites with existing foam materials such as Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS) and evaluates their efficacy as a biodegradable packaging material. Thus, we plan to identify the efficacious strain of mycelium from Pleurotus ostreatus or Ganoderma lucidum and also explore various substrate materials such as cocopith, cardboard, paper, and sawdust. Our preliminary compression results show that the biocomposites can be engineered to have Young\u2019s modulus ranging from 1-3 MPa for both strains.

These fluctuations likely influence multiple aspects of physiology, including the immune response. We demonstrated that the addition of exogenous melatonin increased the proportion of the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia dentifera that became infected by the fungal pathogen Metschnikowia bicuspidata, during the day but not at night. To determine the stage of this host\u2013pathogen interaction at which melatonin may increase susceptibility, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which we raised Daphnia in the presence and absence of exogenous melatonin. To complete its life cycle, Metschnikowia must encounter a foraging host, overcome the host's barrier resistance (gut wall), and evade the host's immune response (internal clearance). We quantified encounter rate by measuring the gut passage time and the number of spores that entered the gut. We also measured the number of spores that successfully entered the body cavity (barrier resistance) and the hemocyte response to spores entering the body cavity (one metric of internal clearance). Finally, we quantified the effect of exogenous melatonin on triggering molting. The addition of exogenous melatonin lengthened gut passage time and decreased the number of spores present in the gut. We found no effect of melatonin on the percentage of gut spores successfully entering the host's body cavity, nor on the hemocyte response. Melatonin is known to influence the timing of molting and hosts that molted during exposure were more likely to become infected, likely due to a decrease in barrier resistance. In a fully factorial experiment, there was a high death rate, low infection rate, and therefore no discernible effect of melatonin on molting, nor molting or melatonin on infection.

The isolate was developed in 50 mm Petri dishes containing a potato, dextrose, and agar (PDA). All plates were incubated in a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) chamber at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00baC with a photoperiod of 12 h for seven days. Plants were inoculated by spraying the fourth, fifth, and sixth fully expanded leaves with a suspension of T. harzianum UFT-25 conidia. Control plants received an application of autoclaved distilled water containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. Analysis of the results revealed a significant difference between the treatments in terms of height, diameter, leaf and branch numbers, dry mass, and chlorophyll.

However, widespread use of synthetic fertilizers has degraded soil organic matter and overall quality, leading to significant environmental consequences and threats to ecosystem services. Challenges in accessing mineral fertilizers, along with growing concerns over environmental sustainability, have driven interest in alternative approaches such as compost, biofertilizers, biopesticides, and microbiome-based strategies to enhance soil fertility and reduce chemical inputs in agriculture. Compost derived from grapevine pruning waste shows promise in addressing agricultural challenges, but further research is needed to understand its effects on nutrient release dynamics and microbial activity. Inoculating compost with a fungal consortium presents an innovative strategy to enhance nutrient cycling and microbial interactions, addressing nutrient availability challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of three fertilization methods on soil health: NPK (mineral fertilizer), PWC (pruning waste compost), and iPWC (pruning waste compost inoculated with fungal consortia). Conducted over 135\u202fdays in a controlled growth chamber, fifteen pots received equal macronutrient doses. Environmental parameters (humidity, temperature, light/dark cycles) were closely monitored. Throughout the experiment, release dynamics of key nutrients, soil enzyme activity, and microbial community responses were rigorously assessed. The results showed that compost inoculated with fungi significantly enhanced soil enzymes activities. Microbial community activity was higher in fungal and compost treatments, with greater functional diversity observed in the mineral fertilizer treatment. Compost released major minerals more slowly than chemical fertilizers, while enhancing the available fraction.

Processes such as biospraying, biostimulation and bioaugmentation, which allow the degradation of contaminants through microbial activity, were described. In addition, the impact of biotechnology on bioremediation was discussed, highlighting the use of omics tools and the application of genetically modified microorganisms to improve the efficiency of these processes. It was emphasized that genetic engineering and genome editing have made it possible to optimize the metabolic capacities of bacteria and fungi to transform toxic substances into less hazardous compounds.Conclusion: It was concluded that bioremediation represents a viable and ecological alternative for dealing with environmental contamination.

In addition, these fertilizers are economically beneficial, since man-made waste products such as phosphorous slags, sewage sludge, and carbon-containing waste can be used to grow biomass of microorganisms and algae. In the course of research, it was found that fertilizers based on Chlorella vulgaris inhibit the growth of mold fungi Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp. in the soil and on the surface of seeds of agricultural crops.

In the meat production chain, their application has gained attention due to the increasing demand for enhanced food safety, quality assurance, food fraud detection, and regulatory compliance. Biosensors can detect foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli/STEC, L. monocytogenes, etc.), spoilage bacteria and indicators, contaminants (pesticides, dioxins, and mycotoxins), antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes, hormones (growth promoters and stress hormones), and metabolites (acute-phase proteins as inflammation markers) at different modules along the meat chain, from livestock farming to packaging in the farm-to-fork (F2F) continuum. By providing real-time data from the meat chain, biosensors enable early interventions, reducing the health risks (foodborne outbreaks) associated with contaminated meat/meat products or sub-standard meat products. Recent advancements in micro- and nanotechnology, microfluidics, and wireless communication have further enhanced the sensitivity, specificity, portability, and automation of biosensors, making them suitable for on-site field applications. The integration of biosensors with blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) systems allows for acquired data integration and management, while their integration with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enables rapid data processing, analytics, and input for risk assessment by competent authorities. This promotes transparency and traceability within the meat chain, fostering consumer trust and industry accountability.

The UTEX 250-A haplotypes are a mosaic of each parental species following mitotic recombination, and two chromosomes are trisomic, which we confirm via allele-specific transformation of a trisomic chromosome.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the potential of Trichoderma and Boesenbergia stenophylla R.M Smith in suppressing Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz., a pathogen associated with chili (Capsicum annum L.) diseases. The efficacy of B. stenophylla in inhibiting C. gloeosporioides showed a maximum PIRG (Percent Inhibition Relative to Control Growth) value of 86.26% on day 8. The formulation of B. stenophylla (jerangau merah) demonstrated potential in suppressing chili anthracnose disease both in vitro and under field conditions. Two Trichoderma spp. isolated from the soil of rehabilitated forest floors were evaluated for their in vitro antagonism against C. gloeosporioides. T. harzianum gradually inhibited the growth of C. gloeosporioides starting from day 2, completely overtaking it by day 8 with a PIRG of 87.40%. T. harzianum inoculants proved effective in controlling the pathogen in vitro and enhancing the growth of chili seedlings, in addition to inhibiting C. gloeosporioides. Meanwhile, T. longibrachiatum also gradually inhibited the growth of C. gloeosporioides, achieving a PIRG of 56.02% by day 8. The presence of Trichoderma in the rhizosphere and on the roots generally improved the root growth of chili seedlings compared to controls inoculated with sterile distilled water (SDW) and those treated with B. stenophylla extracts. Chili seedlings responded better to T. harzianum inoculants than to T. longibrachiatum inoculants and B. stenophylla extracts. By week 8, seedlings inoculated with T. harzianum showed the highest root growth with 26.87 cm in root length and 9.48 g in root fresh mass. Disease assessment studies indicated that T. harzianum exhibited the greatest potential as a biocontrol agent (BCA), reducing disease incidence and severity by 53% and 51%, respectively. Similarly, application of B. stenophylla powder slowed down infection progression and improved chili plant growth, with disease incidence and severity values of 72% and 60%, respectively. Overall, the study demonstrated the efficacy of B. stenophylla in protecting and enhancing the growth of chili plants, potentially replacing harmful chemicals. Both B. stenophylla and T. harzianum inoculants showed effectiveness against C. gloeosporioides, suggesting their potential development as biocontrol agents. Assessment of plant-microbe interactions indicated that T. harzianum mediated induced resistance by producing inducible compounds such as peroxidase (PO). Single inoculation with T. harzianum was most effective, followed by a mixture of T. harzianum + B. stenophylla, delaying symptom onset and reducing disease incidence and severity. In conclusion, the findings suggest that Trichoderma inoculants and B. stenophylla extract powder are effective against C. gloeosporioides while promoting plant growth. Further research into formulation, application frequency, and techniques is essential to maximize their potential as BCAs against Colletotrichum diseases in chili plants.", "venue": "Journal of Plant Stress Physiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "authors": [{"authorId": "2087450882", "name": "Calson Gimang Endawie"}, {"authorId": "88545549", "name": "Franklin Ragai Kundat"}, {"authorId": "2343937895", "name": "Kwan Yee Min"}]}, {"paperId": "88db3dd2034074f32de7a097a12ffe73e085c4ff", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.30872/jatl.7.2.2025.18944.85-88", "CorpusId": 276553254}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88db3dd2034074f32de7a097a12ffe73e085c4ff", "title": "Characteristics of Various Moulds that Potentially as Decomposers Pineapple Industry By-Product", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the potency of three mold isolates Bio GGP2, Bio GGP3 and Bio GGP5.

Plant pathogens that rely on insect vectors often have a positive density dependent relationship, with high vector abundance increasing pathogen spread. However, for pathogens that do not rely on insect vectors, the relationship can be more difficult to predict. Furthermore, environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity, can indirectly alter pathogen spread by impacting vector reproduction or behavior. Therefore, studies examining the interactions between passively transmitted pathogens and potential insect vectors under varying environmental conditions are critical to understanding pathogen spread. Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is the main insect pest of onion (Allium cepa) and co\u2010occurs with many pathogens, including Colletotrichum coccodes Wallr (Glomerellales: Glomerellaceae), a fungal pathogen of onion. We conducted two experiments to understand how different densities of onion thrips and environmental conditions affect pathogen spread. To first determine how onion thrips density affects pathogen spread, we released 0, 5, or 25 onion thrips on C. coccodes inoculated plants, that were symptomatic, and allowed them to move between the symptomatic and asymptomatic plants. Next, to determine the effects of environmental conditions on pathogen spread, we altered temperature and relative humidity and added either 0 or 5 onion thrips to the experiment. Onion thrips dispersal, damage distribution, and pathogen spread 13\u2009days after onion thrips were released were assessed for each experiment. Our results indicate that C. coccodes was only disseminated in the presence of onion thrips and dispersal increased at the 25 onion thrips density. Pathogen spread also increased at 33\u00b0C compared with 22\u00b0C, regardless of relative humidity.

The removal efficiency of various types of biosorbents is discussed in relation to the chemical structure and functional groups presented on the biosorbent surfaces at various process parameters, such as pH, contact time, biosorbent dosage, and initial pharmaceutical concentration. Additionally, the benefits of chemical and physical modifications, immobilization techniques, and the reusability of biosorbents are highlighted.

This study tested whether a fungicide treatment\u2019s effectiveness is indeed related to the amount of fungi in the soil. We compared the emergence and biomass produced from Pseudoroegneria spicata seed that was uncoated, coated with no active ingredient, and fungicide-coated, across five soil treatments promoting different levels of fungal biomass. For uncoated seed, both percent emergence and total biomass of seedlings were highest in autoclaved soil and declined when fungi were present, but the level of fungus did not impact emergence or biomass for fungicide-coated seed. When grown in autoclaved, untreated, or low-fungus soils, percent emergence and total biomass from fungicide-coated seeds were not significantly different from uncoated seeds. However, in medium- and high-fungus soils, the percent emergence and total biomass from fungicide-coated seeds were more than two times greater than uncoated seed (p < 0.05).

The genetic diversity of modern cultivars has been eroded by domestication and selection, increasing their vulnerability to biotic stress due to uniformity. The rapid spread of new highly virulent and aggressive pathogen strains has exacerbated this situation. Three strategies can be used for enhancing disease resistance through genome editing: introducing resistance (R) gene-mediated resistance, engineering nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), and manipulating susceptibility (S) genes to stop pathogens from exploiting these factors to support infection. Utilizing R gene-mediated resistance is the most common strategy for traditional breeding approaches, but the continuous evolution of pathogen effectors can eventually overcome this resistance. Moreover, modifying S genes can confer pleiotropic effects that hinder their use in agriculture. Enhancing disease resistance is paramount for sustainable wheat production and food security, and new tools and strategies are of great importance to the research community. The application of CRISPR-based genome editing provides promise to improve disease resistance, allowing access to a broader range of solutions beyond random mutagenesis or intraspecific variation, unlocking new ways to improve crops, and speeding up resistance breeding.

Most Metarhizium species are also beneficial plant symbionts, and they mainly colonize rhizosphere and rhizoplane with some strains colonizing leaves and stems. The development of Metarhizium and plant association commence either by the attachment of spores to roots or rhizosphere colonization. Rhizosphere hyphae are further attracted to roots by nutrient\u2010rich root exudates, facilitating rhizoplane colonization. Both undifferentiated and differentiated (characterized by appressorial formation) hyphae can penetrate between root epidermal cells, with sporadical colonization. Plant\u2010derived reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in limiting root cell colonization by Metarhizium. Metarhizium utilizes plant\u2010derived sugars and fatty acids for the growth while transferring insect\u2010derived nitrogen to the plants. Additionally, Metarhizium facilitates plant\u2019s utilization of environmental phosphorus, zinc, and iron via increasing the bioavailability of these nutrients.

Many bioactive extracts from Pleurotus species have been found to exhibit antitumor and antioxidant activities.

It contains high levels of sugar and protein and yields a large amount of biomass. Because of these characteristics, it is considered an efficient and cost-effective energy crop with various applications, including phytoremediation and fodder production. A pasteurization technique for this grass that is suited for the simplest formulation is simple and cost-effective for growing oyster mushrooms on small farms. This study used pasteurized Cenchrus fungigraminus as a substrate to grow three mushroom species: Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius and Pleurotus florida. The aim was to evaluate their enzyme activities, growth rate, and yields. The findings demonstrated that the average growth rate of three species grown in pasteurized C.\u00a0fungigraminus was between 25 days and 36 days. Therefore, the mycelium growth rate of P. ostreatus was faster than other pleurotus species in this study. The highest biological efficiency was recorded with P. ostreatus at 78.23%, then P. pulmonarius at 59.88, and lastly, 39.66% P. florida. The changes in five enzyme activities in distinct developmental stages of three different pleurotus species were evaluated. Therefore, the laccase had the highest peak with 13.8 U/g on the 20th day during the growth phase and gradually decreased to the fruiting body stage of P. ostreatus. The expression of manganese peroxidase reached the highest activity of 3.6 U/g in P. ostreatus compared to P. florida and P. pulmonarius on the 10th day.

To enhance the fermentation rate and quality of deer manure composting, we investigated the effects of various conditioners (biochar, zeolite, biochar + zeolite) on the aerobic composting process of deer manure. The results indicated that the combination of biochar and zeolite significantly promoted the degradation of organic matter, resulting in a 34.83% decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content. The addition of biochar was particularly beneficial for nitrogen retention in the compost, with the total nitrogen content reaching its highest level at 39.55 g/kg. Furthermore, the inclusion of zeolite and biochar altered the phosphorus content of the compost, with zeolite demonstrating a more favorable effect. The addition of a conditioner increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota and Proteobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes; the changes in Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, and Glutamicibacter were positively correlated with the changes in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio) and negatively correlated with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels. The mixed conditioner of biochar + zeolite used in composting exhibited low toxicity and the highest degree of decomposition. In summary, the combination of biochar + zeolite as a mixed conditioner is the optimal choice for reducing the toxicity of compost and promoting its maturation.

However, the non-target effects of this strategy on the soil microbiome are largely unknown. We evaluated the effect of cultivating Musa basjoo, Allium tuberosum (Chinese leek), and their co-cultivation on the rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiome under glasshouse conditions. We do not report the impact of Chinese leek on Foc abundances, as this has been previously reported. The bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soil varied depending on the plant type. The microbiomes of allium and bananas were consistently dissimilar, and the co-cultivation treatment contained constituent taxa from both. However, the effect of allium on soil community composition was outweighed by that of bananas in the co-cultivation scenario. Discriminative taxa for allium included members of the genera Sphingomonas, Microbacterium, Flavihumibacter, Brevundimonas, Pseudolabrys, Ramlibacter, Trichoderma, Mortierella and Fusarium. In the case of bananas, predominant biomarkers encompassed members of Rhizobacter, Noviherbaspirillum, Pseudarthrobacter, Aquabacterium, Pseudomonas, Tausonia and Humicola Biomarkers and predictions of functional gene abundances suggest that shifts in the soil microbiome induced by allium are correlated with increases in microorganisms exhibiting potential disease suppression and antibiotic or antifungal traits, whereas those in bananas are associated with plant-growth-promoting microorganisms. The biocontrol efficacy of allium co-cultivation may there involve shifts in the soil microbiome as well as direct impacts of root exudate chemistry on Fusarium plant pathogens.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-11", "authors": [{"authorId": "2150553639", "name": "Eliana Torres-Bedoya"}, {"authorId": "3168842", "name": "D.

However, the metabolic fluxes and consequent costs and benefits of these strategies in a cereal crop have not been examined. We developed a metabolic model describing how the relative growth rate of Zea mays is impacted by hypothetical association with the rhizobium Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis. We found that the lower N content of cereal crops makes the relative growth rate cost associated with acquiring nitrogen from N2-fixing rhizobia smaller than in legumes. Our model also predicts positive synergies between rhizobia and AMF under nutrient-limited conditions but negative synergies under nutrient, particularly phosphorus, replete conditions. These findings indicate that these bioengineering strategies could improve cereal crop yields and may achieve greater gains in tandem, but soil nutrient status of target sites should be considered. Significance Statement Fertilizer application is responsible for substantial environmental impacts and represents a significant cost to farmers, both barriers to sustainable agricultural development. Engineering cereal crops to associate with N2-fixing rhizobia and enhancing existing associations between crops and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are two strategies that could address these challenges. However, quantitative predictions of their potential effectiveness have not been determined. We use metabolic modeling to demonstrate that engineering maize to associate with N2-fixing rhizobia could be a highly metabolic and cost-effective strategy for sustainably supplying nitrogen to cereal crops.

This study explores the multifaceted role of biochar in carbon sequestration and its impact on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. The unique structural and chemical characteristics of biochar enable it to store carbon for centuries, effectively mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a negative carbon footprint. Additionally, biochar alters soil physical properties by improving porosity, aeration, and water retention, which enhances root growth and soil resilience against erosion and extreme weather conditions. Chemically, biochar enhances soil fertility through its high cation exchange capacity and alkaline nature. It retains essential nutrients, prevents leaching, and ameliorates soil acidity, creating a favorable environment for plant growth. Biologically, biochar supports microbial diversity and activity by providing a habitat for beneficial microorganisms such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Despite its numerous benefits, the effectiveness of biochar is influenced by factors such as feedstock type, production conditions, and soil characteristics. Challenges such as economic feasibility, potential nutrient imbalances, and environmental trade-offs must be addressed to optimize its application. Future research should focus on tailoring biochar properties to specific soil and crop needs, scaling up production, and integrating biochar into sustainable land management practices.

Physicochemical analysis revealed significant variations in temperature (36\u201355 \u00b0C), pH (6.5\u20138.3), and nutrient concentrations, with all sites displaying anoxic conditions except for one. Sequencing of the V9 18S rRNA gene identified 134 taxa, predominantly from the Alveolata, Stramenopiles, and Opisthokonta supergroups. The highest diversity and richness were observed in aquifer groups with moderate temperatures and nutrient levels, while extreme sites exhibited reduced diversity. Among the key environmental factors shaping these communities, temperature, pH, and nitrate concentrations were most significant. Photoautotrophic and mixotrophic taxa, such as Ochrophyta, Dinoflagellata, and Chlorophyta, were prominent, reflecting their roles in primary production and nutrient cycling. Decomposers, including Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, were linked to organic matter degradation. Microeukaryotes showed adaptations to extreme conditions, such as thermotolerance and evolutionary shifts from phototrophy to heterotrophy, highlighting their ecological versatility. These findings underscore the potential of microbial eukaryotes in biotechnological applications, such as bioremediation and biofuel production. Genera like Tribonema and Navicula demonstrated promising capabilities in nutrient removal and CO2 fixation.

At the macro level, alpine meadows degradation increased vegetation species diversity, significantly reduced above-ground productivity, and made the soil more barren and alkaline.

This study\u2019s aim is to determine cement dust emissions impacts on various tillage management methods and the formation of cement dust-affected CO2 emissions, soil pH, soil organic matter content, total nitrogen content, available phosphorus, CaCO3 content, bacteria and fungi populations, and enzyme activities. The target of this study is to evaluate how cement dust emissions impact the soil properties and sustainability of different tillage practices. Composite soils from wheat\u2013sugar beet (potato)\u2013fallow cropping sequences under conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) management were collected (0\u201330 cm depth) with three replications at varying distances from a cement factory (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 km). To find differences among individual treatments and distances, a two-way ANOVA was employed along with Duncan\u2019s LSD test comparing the various effects of tillage techniques. The associations between soil chemical and biological properties and CO2 fluxes under the impact of cement dust were examined using Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis. There were notable relationships between soil microbial population, enzyme activities, pH, CaCO3, and CO2 fluxes. The sampling distance from the cement plant had a substantial correlation with soil organic carbon, urease activity, pH, CaCO3, and bacterial populations. According to the study, different tillage methods (CT and NT) affected the diversity and abundance of microorganisms within the soil ecosystem. CT was more beneficial for the microbial population and for sustainable management.", "venue": "Sustainability", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-09", "authors": [{"authorId": "5215531", "name": "S.

However, black mold is a common fungal disease affecting garlic, which was caused by an Aspergillus infection. This disease significantly impacts both the production and quality of garlic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of novel green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) against black mold diseases in garlic. An environmentally friendly green synthesis technique was used to produce ZnO-NPs using zinc-tolerant bacteria Serratia sp. (ZTB24). In the present study the experimental analysis viz. UV-Vis spectroscopy at 380 nm, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential confirmed the successful biosynthesis of green ZnO-NPs from Serratia sp. The poisoned food technique and spore germination test revealed the antifungal activities of ZnO-NPs against A. niger under in vitro conditions. The presence of disease-causing A. niger fungus was confirmed through its isolation from infected garlic bulbs, and it was further identified at the molecular level using inter-transcribed sequence (ITS) rDNA sequencing. ZnO-NPs reduced the mycelial growth up to 90% and the 73% spore germination at 250\u202f\u03bcg\u202fml\u22121 concentration of ZnO-NPs. The ZnO-NPs were further used in vivo at different concentrations (50, 100, 250, and 500\u202fppm) in the post-harvest treatment of garlic. The percentage of disease severity was assessed after 7 and 14\u202fdays, and the application of 500\u202fppm of ZnO-NPs exhibited 0% disease severity in the pre-inoculation method, while disease severity of black mold disease in garlic plant was recorded at 1.10% after 7\u202fdays and 0.90% after 14\u202fdays in the post-inoculation method, compared to the control group. Hence, the antifungal activity of ZnO-NPs synthesized using the green technique paves the way for the development of natural fungicides, offering a sustainable and renewable alternative to traditional chemical control methods.", "venue": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-13", "authors": [{"authorId": "2345561221", "name": "Govind Kumawat"}, {"authorId": "13369538", "name": "D.

Woody species that occur along this sharp gradient must adopt viable ecological strategies to deal with the contrasting environments of these ecosystems. For this, plants are challenged to efficiently coordinate the functioning of ecological strategy dimensions above\u2010 and below\u2010ground.\n\nWe tested hypotheses related to structural changes in vegetation and associated shifts in community\u2010level trait patterns and ecological strategies during woody plant encroachment. We surveyed 60 permanent plots in forest\u2010grassland mosaics at two different times (2012\u20132022) to obtain data on changes in vegetation structure, species composition, abundance and ecological strategies after 10\u2009years without disturbance, capturing a gradient from open and woody plant\u2010encroached grasslands to closed forests. An integrated functional approach was used to assess the different dimensions of plant trait variation, including 10 above\u2010 and below\u2010ground traits, representing whole\u2010plant, leaf, stem and root strategies.\n\nWoody plant encroachment led to a substantial increase in woody plant density in former grasslands, transforming their structure to resemble that of young forests. Interestingly, we found clear trade\u2010offs between above\u2010 and below\u2010ground traits among woody species. On the one hand, the species occurring in grassland had conservative leaves, a strategy for protection against high solar incidence, physical damage and drought, and had roots with a \u2018do\u2010it\u2010yourself\u2019 strategy, which ensures efficiency in the acquisition of nutrients and water in nutrient\u2010limited soils, and had thick bark related to fire resistance. On the other hand, forest species were usually taller and had acquisitive leaves, indicating highly competitive ability in light\u2010limited forests, whereas their roots had an \u2018outsourcing\u2019 strategy of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi in the nutrient\u2010rich soils of forests.\n\nSynthesis: We advanced the current understanding of woody plant encroachment in grasslands by showing the underlying trait\u2010based trade\u2010offs that enable woody species to occur along the transition between forest and grassland through space and time. Importantly, we have shown how below\u2010ground traits are important in explaining the species strategies, with a negative covariance between above\u2010 and below\u2010ground. Our integrative trait\u2010based approach will be helpful in better understanding and managing forest\u2010grassland mosaics in southern Brazil and analogous patchy ecosystems around the world.\n\n", "venue": "Journal of Ecology", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346747134", "name": "Raissa I.

There is a need for disease detection technologies to determine the right time to apply fungicides, as FHB infection begins before visible symptoms appear. Using multispectral remote sensing by an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), wheat plants were observed under field conditions infested with FHB and simultaneously protected with fungicides sprayed with four different types of nozzles, as well as corresponding control plots infested with FHB only. The results showed that the levels of deoxynivalenol (DON) differed significantly between the five treatments, indicating that the control had the highest DON concentration as no fungicide treatment was applied. This study revealed that the assessment of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) after FHB infection could be useful for predicting DON accumulation in wheat, as a significant negative correlation between DON and NDVI values was measured 24 days after anthesis. The decreasing NDVI values at the end of the growth cycle were expected due to senescence and yellowing of the wheat spikes and leaves. Therefore, significant differences in the NDVI were observed between three measurement points on the 13th, 24th, and 45th day after anthesis. Additionally, the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE) were in significant positive correlation with the NDVI at 24th day after anthesis. The use of appropriate measurement points for the vegetation indices can offer the decisive advantage of enabling the evaluation of very large breeding trials or farmers\u2019 fields where the timing of fungicide application is particularly important.", "venue": "AgriEngineering", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-03", "authors": [{"authorId": "2343915728", "name": "Igor Petrovi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "10698604", "name": "F.

We isolated and characterized a new fungal isolate, Neocallimastix cameroonii var. constans, providing a transcriptomic and genomic understanding of its ability to degrade diverse carbohydrates. This anaerobic fungal strain was stably cultivated for multiple years in vitro among members of an initial enrichment microbial community derived from goat feces, and it demonstrated the ability to pair with other microbial members, namely archaeal methanogens to produce methane from lignocellulose. Genomic analysis revealed a higher number of predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes encoded in the N. cameroonii var. constans genome compared to most other sequenced anaerobic fungi. The carbohydrate-active enzyme profile for this isolate contained 660 glycoside hydrolases, 160 carbohydrate esterases, 194 glycosyltrasferases, and 85 polysaccharide lyases. Differential gene expression analysis showed the upregulation of thousands of genes (including predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes) when N. cameroonii var. constans was grown on lignocellulose (reed canary grass) compared to less complex substrates, such as cellulose (filter paper), cellobiose, and glucose. AlphaFold was used to predict functions of transcriptionally active yet poorly annotated genes, revealing feruloyl esterases that likely play an important role in lignocellulose degradation by anaerobic fungi.

Our findings revealed that high temperatures (30 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C) significantly reduced hyphal growth, increased malondialdehyde content and antioxidant enzyme activity, and enhanced the accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids.

Our results revealed a high level of conservation in the rhizosphere microbiomes between wild and domesticated wheat, with minimal divergence in community composition and microbial network structure.

Since ginseng seeds are morpho-physiologically dormant and have a very short lifespan, the harvested seeds need outdoor warm and cold stratification for 100 days each. The seeds were covered by a fruit coat (endocarp), which opened during warm stratification. Farmers must, therefore, dehisce (open the endocarp) seeds annually. The conditions for embryo growth, dehiscence percentage, and endocarp hardness were temperature, watering, stratification substances, solution scarification, and microbial inoculation of the seed endocarp. Watering, temperature (17.5 \u00b0C), and aeration are crucial for embryo growth as a germination condition. Moreover, microbial-mediated endocarp decomposition is necessary for dehiscence and embryonic development. This study suggests that a combination of embryo growth and microbial-mediated decomposition of the endocarp during warm stratification is a prerequisite for the dehiscence of ginseng seeds, implying physical and morpho-physiological dormancy. Any microbes (fungi, actinomycetes, and bacteria) tested with high or low cellulose-decomposing ability increased the dehiscence percentage by 66% compared to the untreated control. Seeds of three varieties of P. ginseng and one variety of P. quinquefolius were successfully dehisced by fungal inoculation of seeds.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is a crop of economic relevance in Mexico. Nuevo Le\u00f3n stands out in production; however, in the municipality of Aramberri, post-harvest losses have been reported due to diseases of unknown etiology. The objective of this work was to identify the fungi associated with the postharvest deterioration of A. sativum bulbs in Aramberri, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico and to evaluate their in vitro sensitivity to fungicides. Materials and Methods. From bulbs with evidence of deterioration and necrosis, fungi were isolated in PDA medium. Four isolates were identified by morphological analysis and one isolate from each morphological species was identified by molecular analysis. The pathogenicity of the four isolates on symptom-free bulbil was evaluated. In addition, in vitro susceptibility tests of the isolates to protective and systemic fungicides were performed. Fungicides were evaluated at three concentrations and mycelial growth reduction (MGR) and conidial germination inhibition (CGI) was estimated. Results. The fungi Alternaria embellisia and Penicillium allii were identified in association with A. sativum bulbs with postharvest deterioration. P. allii showed the ability to develop internal infections from wounds; A. embellisia only showed growth on wounds. There were significant differences (p <0.0001) in the effectiveness of fungicides on the two species. Propiconazole and copper hydroxide inhibited 100% MGR and CGI in both fungi, at all doses evaluated. Conclusion. P. allii is first reported as a causative agent of green garlic rot in Mexico.

We used existing plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal datasets to apply a new, well validated generation of network models relaxing the very limiting assumptions of traditional null models. We focused on nestedness and modularity, which have been related to the functioning and stability of communities. Given the existent literature, we expected nestedness and modularity to be prevalent. We modelled plant-AM fungal associations using maximum entropy networks with a degree sequence, soft constraint to generate null distributions for nestedness and modularity. Most plant-AM fungal associations were anti-nested and modular. This pattern was consistent across habitat types and multiple spatial scales. Anti-nestedness can easily emerge from modularity when network patterns are determined by the identity of the plant and AM fungal nodes.

During wine fermentation, S. cerevisiae must be able to cope with several stresses, such as limited nitrogen availability; nitrogen deficiencies in grape must could lead to stuck or sluggish fermentations, generating for the wine industry significant economic losses. A microbiological alternative to this problem is the generation of yeast strains with low nitrogen requirements for fermentation. In this context, it is important to study the natural diversity regarding adaptation to low nitrogen conditions, especially in terms of searching for beneficial alleles with potential industrial applications. In the present work, we validated the impact of specific SNPs present in the RRT5 gene in an industrial genetic background (T73 strain), analyzing both growth kinetics under microculture conditions and fermentative phenotypes in a larger volume. In this way, we were able to validate that these SNPs do indeed have an impact on the growth kinetics and fermentative capabilities of this strain, although the particular effect depends on the type of must used (synthetic or natural) and the nitrogen content (limiting or non-limiting). In particular, one mutation (601A>C) caused slower fermentation kinetics in the nitrogen-limited natural must but did not affect the ethanol produced or the amount of sugars consumed, in addition to producing more glycerol and consuming less phenylalanine, which could have a positive impact on the organoleptic properties of the wine produced and therefore an industrial potential.

Procyanidins are compounds beneficial to human health and can be found in nature in fruit, grain, seeds, and beverages, among other foods. The zero-waste approach has allowed for the valorization of by-products from the food industry. Currently, coffee pulp is the target of research on extraction, purification, and alternative use. Research on the fungal degradation of procyanidins has emerged as an avenue for the efficient use of these by-products. In this study, the degradation and biotransformation of procyanidin is evaluated and comprises three steps: first, the extraction and partial purification of procyanidins from coffee pulp; second, the production of the potential procyanidin-degrading enzyme by submerged fermentation with Aspergillus niger GH1; third, enzymatic extracellular extract evaluation using a model system with commercial procyanidin C1. The biodegradation/biotransformation results reveal the formation of new compounds, including a final compound with an m/z of 289, possibly a monomeric molecule such as catechin or epicatechin.

To understand the P. triticina population virulence analysis of the population in Canada has been conducted annually for over 80 years. The virulence profile of the P. triticina population and virulence to key resistance genes changes significantly over time, and differs between regions. Recently, genetic analysis via DNA sequencing of representative isolate from the P. triticina populations from 2018-2022 initially revealed three diverse groups in Canada. All isolates within group one had the same two mating type alleles, group two isolates all had a second combination of alleles, whereas group three isolates were partitioned into eight sub-groups encompassing different genetic clades. A fourth distinct group was later found from British Columbia. To combat leaf rust, the resistance genes Lr2a, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr16, Lr21 and Lr34 have been used extensively in Canadian spring wheat cultivars. Lr34, Lr46 and Lr67 are unique among resistance genes in that they are non-race specific, conditioning partial resistance to all isolates, while also providing resistance to other wheat diseases. Critically, Lr34 and Lr67 was demonstrated to confer resistance to Fusarium Head Blight. The complete picture underlying Lr34 functions is not fully understood, but only Lr34res lines accumulate the fungistatic compound 1-O-p-coumaroyl-3-O-feruloylglycerol. Lr34 also produces leaf tip necrosis, this is enhanced at low temperatures.

Boufeggous Gharas) to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Albedinis (Foa), the causal agent of Bayoud disease. Despite its high fruit quality and local appreciation, the Boufeggous Gharas variety is highly susceptible to Foa and is currently at risk of extinction, underscoring the urgent need for its sustainable management. The results demonstrated that Boufeggous Gharas seedlings inoculated with a consortium of indigenous AMF showed significantly improved shoot and root length, leaf number, and biomass as compared to non-mycorrhized seedlings. In contrast, Foa-infected seedlings showed significantly reduced growth, with a 46.6% decrease in shoot height and a 50.4% reduction in root length compared to non-infected seedlings. Interestingly, AMF inoculation mitigated this sensitivity to Foa, significantly restoring growth parameters. Seedlings treated with AMF + Foa showed a 51% increase in shoot height and a 61% improvement in root length, along with over 100% gains in shoot and root biomass compared to seedlings infected solely with Foa. This study provides the first evidence of integrating AMF into sustainable date palm cultivation practices to mitigate the impacts of biotic stresses, thereby promoting the preservation and valorization of vulnerable date palm varieties.

These methods allow for comparisons between BCAs/BPEs and conventional chemical treatments, the assessment of potential synergies, the ability to control fungicide\u2010resistant strains and the evaluation of phytotoxicity. The goal is to improve the understanding and integration of BCAs and BPEs into agricultural practices, reducing reliance on agrochemicals and promoting sustainable management of fungal diseases.

Soil microbial diversity is vital in supporting ecosystem multifunctionality and preventing pathogen growth. Recent studies have revealed that farming activities homogenize microbial communities across distant sites, which may lead to functional homogenization on that scale. However, given the redundancy of microbial functions, functional homogenization driven by farming may occur on a broader scale than taxonomic homogenization. We compared the taxonomic and functional compositions of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities between natural lands and farmlands at scales ranging from within-site (\u223c200 m) to across-site (\u223c1500 km) in Kenya and Malawi, using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS genes and the prediction of microbial functions. Soil microbial functional compositions were homogenized more broadly than taxonomic compositions in farmlands compared to natural lands, suggesting that similar functional responses to farming occur across scales where different taxa thrive. Furthermore, environmental factors predominantly influenced within-site homogeneity, whereas farming itself was a significant contributor to across-site homogeneity, indicating an overriding influence of farming compared to environmental variations. Additionally, pathogenic fungi were relatively more abundant in farmlands, likely due to reduced species competition and farming-induced environmental changes such as low soil pH.

Methods: Fermentations were performed using Pichia kudriavzevii NPCC1651 (isolated from cider) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae \u00d1IF8 (isolated from wine) in pure, simultaneous, and sequential inoculations. Viable cell counts, glucose and fructose consumption kinetics, and malic acid depletion were measured during fermentation, while physicochemical and aromatic profiles of the ciders were also analyzed in the final products. Results: P. kudriavzevii was capable of coexisting with S. cerevisiae until the final stages of fermentation, independently from the inoculation strategy employed. The simultaneous inoculation at a 1:1 ratio and the sequential inoculation initiated with S. cerevisiae showed the best performance. Both strategies produced ciders with high fermentative efficiency and elevated levels of lactic and succinic acids, isoamyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, isoamyl acetate, and 2-phenylethyl acetate while reducing acetic acid and ethyl acetate levels. These fermentations also achieved higher malic acid consumption compared to pure cultures.

In the present study, a mycorrhizal fungus designated as BJ1 was isolated from the roots of Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Reiehb.f. Fluorescence staining and morphological analysis revealed that this fungus exhibited characteristics highly similar to those of Tulasnella. Subsequently, the strain was confirmed as a new strain of Tulasnella through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of four loci: the internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-ITS4 (ITS), ATP synthase (C14436), glutamate synthase (C4102), and ATP deconjugase (C3304). Additionally, we investigated the in vitro biological activity of strain BJ1 and its effects on germination and growth of B. striata seeds. The results indicated that BJ1 is capable of producing plant cell-degrading enzymes, including pectinase and protease. Furthermore, it demonstrates an ability to solubilize inorganic phosphorus and synthesize indoleacetic acid (IAA). Nevertheless, it does not exhibit laccase activity or possess the capacity to produce siderophores, nor can it solubilize organic phosphorus. Microscopic observations revealed that strain BJ1 mainly colonizes the base of the B. striata protocorm, thereby enhancing seed germination, growth, and expansion. Notably, by the fourth week of germination, 74.23% of seeds in the symbiotic group had developed to stage 5, a significantly higher proportion compared to 50.43% in the non-symbiotic group. Additionally, the length, width, and fresh weight of seeds in the symbiotic group were 2.2 times, 1.8 times, and 3.7 times greater than those in the non-symbiotic group, respectively. Furthermore, by adding L-tryptophan as a substrate during co-cultivation with BJ1, there was a significant enhancement in IAA synthesis capability; this also led to a marked acceleration in the symbiotic germination process of B. striata seeds.

To investigate the relationship between sporocarps found at the base of coffee trees, the cysts covering their roots, and the mealybug insects within them, samples of these three organisms\u2014sporocarps, cysts, and mealybugs\u2014were collected from 27 coffee plants across three farms in the departments of Norte de Santander and Quind\u00edo, Colombia. Fungi and cysts were identified by sequencing a nuclear gene region of the 28S large ribosomal subunit (28S rDNA) using the primers LSU200-F and LSU481-R. Fungal identification was further confirmed through classical taxonomy. Mealybugs were identified by sequencing a region of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) with CIF-CIR primers, corroborated through classical taxonomy. This study identified four fungal species associated with four species of Pseudococcidae. The fungus Phlebopus beniensis was associated with the mealybugs Pseudococcus elisae, Dysmicoccus neobrevipes, D. brevipes, and Pseudococcus nr. sociabilis. Phlebopus portentosus was linked to D. neobrevipes, while Xerophorus olivascens and Boletinellus rompelii were associated with other Pseudococcidae species. Additionally, the fungus Pseudolaccaria pachyphylla was found in coffee plants harboring mealybugs. These findings confirm the existence of specific associations between fungal species and mealybug insects that affect coffee plants.", "venue": "Agronomy", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-24", "authors": [{"authorId": "2347102364", "name": "Luz Andrea Carmona-Valencia"}, {"authorId": "1402717075", "name": "Lucio Navarro-Escalante"}, {"authorId": "2278236023", "name": "Pablo Benavides"}, {"authorId": "2344295307", "name": "Zulma Nancy Gil Palacio"}]}, {"paperId": "5dfb5744362a9a52ab06e482d2ada4a549ecad68", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/pr13020413", "CorpusId": 276127659}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dfb5744362a9a52ab06e482d2ada4a549ecad68", "title": "Sustainable Bio-Preservation of Concentrated Yogurt (Labneh) Using Syzygium aromaticum L.", "abstract": "Bio-preservation strategies for sustainable food and dairy products are some of the most in-demand techniques that expand shelf life and meet consumer requirements.

Ethanolic extract of clove flower buds was applied during the manufacturing of labneh as a bio-preserving agent. The effect of the sprayed-clove extract on the chemical composition, microbiological composition, texture profile, antioxidant capabilities, aromatic compounds, and sensory properties of the labneh cheese were determined. Phytochemical profiling showed chaulmoogric acid, trans-cinnamic acid, propyl gallate, and sinapine as major constituents in clove extract. Antimicrobial inhibitory potential was estimated against both foodborne pathogens and food spoilage microorganisms. Clove extract showed a promising inhibitory effect against fungi recording 1 mg/mL maximally. Labneh samples with clove extract contained the highest records of antioxidant activity in addition to having no record of any fungal growth after 60 days. It is also distinguished by its eugenol, \u03b2-Caryophyllene, and acetyleugeno as aroma compound content. All spray-treated samples achieved the highest scores in sensory properties during the storage period. It can be concluded that clove extract, when sprayed on the surface of labneh cheese, produced an antifungal effect in a smart and economic way which boosted the shelf life, quality, enhanced nutritional value, and the antioxidant capacity of labneh cheese.", "venue": "Processes", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-04", "authors": [{"authorId": "1418439906", "name": "Mohamed F.

In 2023, we conducted a systematic analysis on the application of microbial fertilizers (compost) at varying levels (CK, MF1, MF2, and MF3) during different growth stages of cotton (bud, flowering, bolling, and boll opening). Results showed that appropriate microbial fertilizer application (MF2 and MF3) enhanced soil bacterial and fungal diversity, enriched beneficial microorganisms (e.g., Acidobacteriota and Candidatus Udaeobacter), improved soil nutrient availability, and increased antioxidant enzyme activity (POD, SOD), while reducing membrane lipid peroxidation (MDA). These effects led to significant improvements in yield traits, such as cotton plant height, number of fruiting branches and bolls, boll weight, and coat weight. The highest microbial fertilizer application level (MF3) resulted in a 54.35% increase in seed yield and a 75.37% increase in lint yield compared to CK. PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and multivariate statistical analyses revealed that microbial fertilizer application fine-tuned soil microbial community composition, emphasizing the dynamic balance of the microbial ecosystem.

In both cases, the cause of the rot was the causative agent of potato rubber rot, the fungus Geotrichum candidum Link, belonging to the kingdom Fungi, division Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, order Saccharomycetales, family Dipodascaceae, genus Geotrichum. This is the first case of identification of this phytopathogen on potatoes in the Krasnoyarsk Region. According to literature data, even planting tubers slightly affected by rubber rot lead to a 20\u201330 % reduction in yield and 15 % yield loss during storage. The fungus reproduces using rectangular (less often round) arthrospores measuring 5.0\u201312.6 \u00d7 3.0\u20135.5 \u00b5m, which in model experiments at a temperature of 25 \u00b11 \u00b0C are formed 13\u201314 hours after artificial infection of the tissue tubers. Due to the fact that the symptoms caused by G. candidum on potato tubers are similar to the symptoms caused by a number of other phytopathogenic fungi, a biological method should be used to reliably diagnose the pathogen. As a diagnostic sign, we recommend using the formation of arthrospores of G. candidum on the affected tissues in situ or after 14\u201324 hours of incubation in a humid chamber, as well as the germination of arthrospores by mycelium with characteristic dichotomous branching of individual hyphae and rapid fragmentation of hyphae into arthrospores.", "venue": "Bulletin of KSAU", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-06", "authors": [{"authorId": "2304070436", "name": "Sergey Khizhnyak"}, {"authorId": "2304119965", "name": "Sofya Ovsyankina"}, {"authorId": "2071524212", "name": "A.

A total of thirty (30) samples were taken over the course of three months from two composting sites that contained different coloured polyethylene bags. The identification and characterization of isolates was done using morphological and biochemical techniques while the Analytical Profile Index (Biomeuriex API kit) was used to confirm the identities of the isolates. The overall load of heterotrophic bacteria varied between 3.30 x 104 cfu/g to 1.50 x 106 cfu/g, while that of fungi ranged from 1.02\u00d7104sfu/g to 1.26\u00d7106sfu/g. Pseudomonas sp. showed the highest prevalence (30%), followed by Staphylococcus sp. (16%). The least frequently occurring bacteria were Micrococcus varians and Proteus mirabilis (4% each). The most common species of fungi were Aspergillus niger (25%) and Fusarium sp. (23.33%), while Aspergillus candidus exhibited the lowest prevalence (3.33%). There was an increase in the temperature of the compost from 24\u00b0 C to 29 \u00b0C in the two sites and an increase in the pH from 6.7 to 7.7.

TasA enables Bacillus to tightly adhere to fungal hyphae, disrupts the \u03b2-glucan layer, and compromises fungal cytoskeletal integrity synergistically with fengycin, which causes cytological damage. Additionally, TasA acts as a carrier for bacillaene, amplifying its fungistatic activity. In response, B. cinerea mounts a multifaceted defense, enzymatically degrading fengycin, producing antibacterial oxylipins, and activating adaptive programs such as hyphal branching and chlamydospore formation.

Biodiversitas 26: 377-385. The rate at which organic materials decompose is influenced by their cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose content. To accelerate the decomposition process, cellulolytic microorganisms can be employed, which can be isolated from organic materials. Tea plants, as a significant plantation commodity, produce various types of waste during processing, including solid, liquid, and gas wastes. Solid waste from tea factories is produced in large quantities year-round and has substantial potential as a source of organic material. This research aimed to find cellulolytic microbes that were sourced from tea waste and have superior potential in the decomposition of organic matter, especially tea waste. The research involved several stages: isolating microbes from semi-processed waste from the Bah Butong tea factory, purifying the microbes to obtain pure isolates, testing the semi-qualitative potency of these isolates on CMC (Carboxyl methyl cellulase) media, and assessing the degradation potential of the superior isolates on raw tea factory waste. The research findings revealed the presence of five bacteria and two fungi from tea factory waste that have potential as decomposer microbes: Enterobacter oligotrophicus (AS), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia H05 (BS), S. maltophilia (CS), Priestia megaterium (DS), Methylophilus methylotrophus (ES) and cellulolytic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus (J1) and Aspergillus corrugatus (J2). Overall, the use of these cellulolytic bacteria and fungi can accelerate the decomposition of tea factory waste, with compost nitrogen content increasing by 102%.

Many countries have reported blast diseases associated with rice yield loss. In Indonesia, this disease also destroys rice production in several rice fields in West Java, East Java, Central Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The objectives of this study were to identify rice blast fungal isolates in West Sumatra and assess the resistance level of eight local and modern rice genotypes to this disease. Additionally, the rice genotypes were also evaluated for the presence of Pi genes associated with blast resistance by utilizing 25 simple sequence-repeats (SSR) markers known to be linked to rice blasts. The seedlings of all rice genotypes were exposed to fungal isolates to determine their blast resistance capacity based on leaf morphological traits. Before conducting blast resistance testing, the local isolates of rice blast fungus were molecularly identified by aligning sequences in a pairwise comparison. Based on the identification process, three P. oryzae (MoK19-49, MoK19-45, and MoK19-28) fungal isolates were identified. The confirmed P. oryzae isolate MoK19-28 was then used to assess the blast resistance of the rice genotypes using the SES-blast test. The resistance levels of all genotypes were evaluated by observing the morphology of infected leaves for 24 days. Four genotypes, namely Cantik Manis (CM), Bungo Sungkai (BS), Inpari 48 Blas (IB), and Inpago 9 (Ip9), exhibited resistance to leaf blast caused by P. oryzae isolate MoK19-28. Meanwhile, Pulau Batu (PB), Mundam Putiah (MP), and IR64-Sub1 (IR) displayed intermediate resistance to the disease. In contrast, the blast fungus P. oryzae isolate MoK19-28 severely impacted the Kuriak (K) genotype. The rice variety IB contains several Pi genes, specifically Pi1, Pi9, Pikh, and Pi37, which are associated with enhanced resistance to leaf blast caused by P. oryzae isolate MoK19-28. This genetic characteristic sets it apart from susceptible genotypes.

The interactions of metabolically active atmospheric microorganisms with cloud organic matter can alter the atmospheric carbon cycle. Upon deposition, atmospheric microorganisms can influence microbial communities in surface Earth systems. However, the metabolic activities of cultivable atmospheric microorganisms in settled habitats remain less understood. Here, we cultured typical bacterial and fungal species isolated from the urban atmosphere using tryptic soy broth (TSB) and Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB), respectively, and investigated their exometabolites to elucidate their potential roles in biogeochemical cycles. Molecular compositions of exometabolites were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Annotation through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database helped identify metabolic processes. Results showed that bacterial and fungal strains produced exometabolites with lower H\u2009/\u2009C and higher O\u2009/\u2009C ratios compared with both consumed and resistant compounds. As CHON compounds are abundant in both TSB (85\u2009%) and SDB (78\u2009%), CHON compounds also constituted over 50\u2009% of the identified exometabolite formulas. Bacterial strains produced more abundant CHONS compounds (25.2\u2009%), while fungal exometabolites were rich in CHO compounds (31.7\u2009%). These microbial exometabolites predominantly comprised aliphatic/peptide-like and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecule (CRAM)-like compounds. Significant variations in metabolites were observed among different microbial strains. Bacteria exhibited proficiency in amino acid synthesis, while fungi were actively involved in amino acid metabolism, transcription, and expression processes. Lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism varied widely among bacterial strains, while fungi exhibited notable differences in carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism. This study provides new insights into the transformation and potential oxidative capacity of atmospheric microorganisms concerning organic matter at air\u2013land/water interfaces. These findings are pivotal for assessing the biogeochemical impacts of atmospheric microorganisms in clouds or following their deposition.\n", "venue": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-10", "authors": [{"authorId": "2312930506", "name": "Rui Jin"}, {"authorId": "2245155264", "name": "Wei Hu"}, {"authorId": "2205347545", "name": "Peimin Duan"}, {"authorId": "2127492576", "name": "Ming Sheng"}, {"authorId": "2146031689", "name": "Dandan Liu"}, {"authorId": "2313046943", "name": "Ziye Huang"}, {"authorId": "2253563752", "name": "Mutong Niu"}, {"authorId": "3273624", "name": "Libin Wu"}, {"authorId": "2274754577", "name": "Junjun Deng"}, {"authorId": "2238968114", "name": "Pingqing Fu"}]}, {"paperId": "4e718f2fef45b4de01f4b53f5fe8a327eb275eff", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.56369/tsaes.5604", "CorpusId": 276423912}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e718f2fef45b4de01f4b53f5fe8a327eb275eff", "title": "TOLERANCIA A CADMIO Y RESISTENCIA AL DA\u00d1O POR Bemisia tabaci INDUCIDA POR UN CONSORCIO DE HONGOS MICORR\u00cdZICOS ARBUSCULARES EN Solanum lycopersicum L.", "abstract": "Background. Cadmium (Cd) is a potentially toxic element that when released in permeable soils such as those of Yucatan enters directly into the horticultural systems and in general into the food web causing several problems. It is known that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) shows tolerance to the element cadmium and resistance to damage by various pests, however, the biological mechanism that is triggered in its interaction with microorganisms under this type of stress conditions is little known. Objective. To analyze the effect of a consortium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on Cd tolerance and resistance to B. tabaci damage in S. lycopersicum L. Methodology. A split-plot design was used with the following factors: 1) mycorrhizal fungal consortium: control (M\u2013) and mycorrhizal fungal (M+); 2) damage by B. tabaci: control (D-) and presence (D+); and 3) addition of Cd at three levels: control (C), Cd at 0.005 ppm (Cd+) and Cd at 0.020 ppm (Cd++). Mycorrhization, growth and plant defense were estimated. Results. Colonization of 39% and 49% was found, even with the addition of Cd+ and Cd++, respectively. Likewise, positive effects of mycorrhizal fungi on plant height growth and leaf thickness were recorded, interestingly despite the addition of cadmium. Also, compensatory growth responses in terms of leaflet production were recorded, but in the absence of mycorrhizal fungi and in the presence of B. tabaci. Additionally, the mycorrhizal fungi produced less hard leaves in the presence of B. tabaci, which suggests an effect of an improvement in the nutritional quality of the leaves. Implications. Plant growth of tomato plants could be as result of inherent plant growth more than other extrinsically factors such as cadmium or B. tabaci. Conclusions. Tomato plants showed positive effects on cadmium tolerance and resistance to damage by B. tabaci, although inherent plant growth could be a very important mechanism to be considered in the future.", "venue": "Tropical and Subtropical Agroecosystems", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Agricultural and Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-11", "authors": [{"authorId": "2345938374", "name": "Shirley Margarita Amaya-Martin"}, {"authorId": "2237251002", "name": "H.

Biogas is a cost-effective, ecologically friendly, sustainable energy source that is also a reliable method to handle food waste. Methods This study used rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F to maximize the production of biogas from household consumption of three substrates such as cattle manure, cafeteria leftover foods, and fruit and vegetable wastes. Plastic 0.6 L digesters operating at a mesophilic temperature (30\u00b0C) were used to produce biogas from the mixed waste. Biogas production was recorded after the 60-day retention period. Standard methods were used to figure out parameters like pH, total solids, organic carbon volatile solids, and moisture content of the raw mixed wastes. This study was carried out experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 \u00d7 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result The corresponding VS/TS ratios for cattle manure, fruit and vegetable waste, and leftover cafeteria food waste were 91.2%, 80.2%, and 78.3%. More biogas was produced using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F than from mixed wastes without inoculums. The highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml) was generated by mixing 10 ml of S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F with the rumen fluids (100 ml).

Surprisingly, the expansion of these traditional European strains into other human-associated niches, including the human body, has been very limited. This is in stark contrast to the Mixed-origin clade commercial baking yeasts, which consists of only a few globally distributed clonal lineages that dominate the yeast market and recurrently colonize sourdoughs and human hosts. These clonal lineages consistently maintain their ploidy, unique heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements, and stable aneuploidies in addition to several diverse structural variants.

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER- LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER\u2018s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones. Collectively, powdery mildew fungi require RALF signalling for apoplastic pH regulation and cell wall structural organization for successful colonization, highlighting a novel mechanism for host susceptibility by obligate biotrophic fungi.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "authors": [{"authorId": "2197548744", "name": "Henriette Leicher"}, {"authorId": "2343641089", "name": "Sebastian Schade"}, {"authorId": "2038356807", "name": "Jan W.

They frequently contaminate staple foods, including fish products, in warm, humid environments. Silver cyprinid, commonly known as silverfish, is an essential and affordable source of protein in Uganda, consumed by many households. However, the drying, storage, and handling practices involved in its sale raise concerns about the potential for aflatoxin contamination, particularly in local markets. This study aimed to assess the levels of aflatoxins in silver cyprinid sold in Kansanga-Kampala. A total of 10 silver cyprinid samples were collected from different vendors in Kansanga for analysis. The study employed Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a highly sensitive and specific method, to detect and quantify the presence of aflatoxins in these samples. The analysis involved the preparation of aflatoxin standard solutions (B1, B2, G1, and G2) to create calibration curves by plotting response against concentration. Calibration curves were linear, with coefficients of determination (R\u00b2 values) greater than 0.99 for all aflatoxin types. An injection volume of 1\u00b5L was used and 7 levels of the aflatoxin standards were employed having 1,5,10,25,50,75 and 100ppb. However, results from the analysis of silverfish samples showed no detectable levels of aflatoxins (ND), suggesting that the silverfish from this particular market were free from aflatoxin contamination. This is a positive finding for public health as aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic and can lead to liver cancer, immune suppression, and stunted growth in children when consumed over time. It indicates that silverfish sold in Kansanga, Kampala, during the sampling period may be considered safe for consumption with respect to aflatoxin contamination. While this result is positive, the potential for aflatoxin contamination remains a concern due to environmental factors such as humidity and temperature, which can fluctuate throughout the year. Therefore, regular monitoring of aflatoxin levels in silver cyprinid and other food products is recommended to ensure ongoing food safety. In conclusion, this study establishes a baseline for aflatoxin contamination in silver cyprinid sold in Kansanga and demonstrates that, during the period of analysis, the risk of aflatoxin exposure from silver cyprinid consumption is negligible. However, to maintain this standard, it is crucial to implement sustained preventive measures, including better storage infrastructure and vendor education to safeguard public health and the integrity of the local food supply.\n\nKeywords: Aflatoxins; Silver cyprinid; Food safety; LC-MS/MS; Public health", "venue": "IAA Journal of Scientific Research", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-12", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346859597", "name": "Nambogga Judith"}, {"authorId": "2317675616", "name": "Ampaire Wycliffe"}]}, {"paperId": "4ac7d08d139dc1de9d02d0742d9c970ee293fd0d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2025.02.21.639425", "CorpusId": 276569292}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ac7d08d139dc1de9d02d0742d9c970ee293fd0d", "title": "Mycobiome of Pinus pinaster trees naturally infected by the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus", "abstract": "Fungi are important biological elements in the Pine wilt disease (PWD) complex. In the late stages of the disease, the pinewood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus feeds on the fungal flora available in the pine tree for survival and multiplication. Previous studies have confirmed a close relation between the PWN and blue-stain fungi (Ophiostomatales), which are necrotrophic pathogens associated with bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). The PWN is able to grow densely in the presence of these fungi, which results in a higher number of nematodes transferred to the insect-vector Monochamus spp. To understand the spatial diversity and structure of Pinus pinaster mycobiome, wood samples from PWN-infected and non-infected pine trees were collected in three locations of Continental mainland Portugal with different PWD records, during the maturation phase of the insect-vector M. galloprovincialis (winter 2019-spring 2020). The PWN-mycobiome from the PWN-infected P. pinaster was also characterized. A total of 27 samples of P. pinaster and 13 samples of PWN from PWN-infected trees were characterized using ITS2 amplicon sequencing. The diversity and structure of the fungal communities in P. pinaster varied with disease status suggesting that the PWN presence affects the endophytic fungal communities. For both P. pinaster and PWN fungal communities, differences were also associated with locations (recent PWD loci Seia, and long-term PWN locus Companhia das Lez\u00edrias and Tr\u00f3ia).

Comparative transcriptomics between diverse fungal pathogens and non-pathogens provided insights into regulatory mechanisms behind the initiation of infectious processes. We examined the gene expression patterns of 3,845 single-copy orthologous genes (SCOGs) across five phylogenetically distinct species, including the opportunistic human pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and A. nidulans, and nonpathogenic species Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma asperelloides, at four sequential stages of spore germination. Ancestral status of gene expression was inferred for nodes along the phylogeny. By comparing expression patterns of the SCOGs with their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), we identified genes that exhibit divergent levels of expression during spore germination when comparing fungal pathogens to non-pathogens. We focused on genes related to the MAPK pathway, nitrogen metabolism, asexual development, G-protein signaling, and conidial-wall integrity. Notably, orthologs of the transcription activator abaA, a known central regulator of conidiation, exhibited significant divergence in gene expression in F. oxysporum. This dramatic expression change in abaA was accompanied by structural modifications of phialides in F. oxysporum, and revealed how these changes impact development of offspring, formation of aerial hyphae, spore production, and pathogenicity. Our research provides insights into ecological adaptations observed during the divergence of these species, specifically highlighting how divergence in gene expression during spore germination contributes to their ability to thrive in distinct environments. Author Summary The fungi of the phylum Ascomycota include plant and animal pathogens, endophytes, and saprotrophs, some of which are model organisms for biological investigation, and usually have abundant genomic and transcriptomic data. In this study, transcriptomics was studied during spore germination in five species: the opportunistic human pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus nidulans, and the nonpathogenic species Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma asperelloides. We have inferred divergence in gene expression for 3,845 single-copy orthologous genes (SCOGs) along these lineages. Genes related to the MAPK pathway, nitrogen metabolism, conidia-related regulators, G protein signaling, and conidial-wall integrity exhibited dramatic expression shifts in the lineages of the opportunistic human pathogens evolving towards true pathogenic species. Notably, abaA, a known central regulator of conidiation, exhibited striking divergence in expression in the opportunistic pathogens, resulting in structural modifications in phialides that were more similar to pathogenic species, and revealing how these changes impact development of aerial hyphal formation, spore production, and pathogenicity. These findings provide insights into ecological adaptations resulting from divergence in gene expression, and reveal dynamic transcriptional changes, which may be crucial for the adaptation of opportunistic pathogens to changing environments. By elucidating the shifting roles of abaA, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the divergence mechanisms underlying development and pathogenicity in fungi.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-03", "authors": [{"authorId": "2332477836", "name": "Da-Woon Kim"}, {"authorId": "2237513000", "name": "Malaika K.

Aims Our paper summarises the history and rediscovery of Ngilgaitch/Gilbert\u2019s potoroo, outlines the diverse research conducted to inform recovery, describes key management actions, and documents the fluctuating fortunes of the species between 1994 and 2024. Methods We summarise research and management actions to promote the species\u2019 recovery at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and nearby reserves. Key results About 40 Ngilgaitch/Gilbert\u2019s potoroo survived in heathland on the slopes of Maardjitup Gurlin/Mount Gardner, feeding almost exclusively on the fruiting bodies of hypogeal fungi. Two \u2018insurance\u2019 populations were established between 2005 and 2014 by translocation from the original population to Bald Island (810\u00a0ha) and a mainland enclosure (380\u00a0ha). These colonies proved critical to the species\u2019 survival when a wildfire consumed most of the habitat at Two Peoples Bay in November 2015, causing the functional extinction of the population. Efforts have begun to restore this population through translocation from the insurance populations. Conclusion Establishing new potoroo populations by translocation has been the most valuable recovery technique for this species. Current and predicted climate change must be considered when choosing translocation sites. Management of all populations requires effective fire management, feral predator control, and actions derived from genetic information.

The ecological intercropping pattern of medicinal plants is a planting technology that achieves efficient, high-quality and sustainable production of Chinese medicinal materials by increasing the diversity of farmland ecosystems and improving the stability of soil micro-ecosystems, thereby alleviating the continuous cropping disorder of medicinal plants. However, there remains a lack of research on the ecological intercropping cultivation of ginseng. We constructed a Panax ginseng/Arisaema amurense intercropping model to explore the changes in soil nutrients, enzyme activities, soil microbial communities and ginseng quality. The findings of this study demonstrated that intercropping could decelerate the acidification process of soils and effectively increased 37.02% of soil organic matter, 32.39% of total nitrogen, 5.18% of total potassium and 9.03% of available phosphorus contents in ginseng inter-root soil compared with monocropping. The results revealed that intercropping increased the soil urease and soil acid phosphatase activities while reducing the soil sucrase activity in the inter-root soil. Additionally, intercropping elevated the \u03b1-diversity of the inter-root soil bacterial community and diminished the composition and abundance of the fungal community. The intercropping exhibited a pronounced inhibitory impact on two common genera of pathogenic fungi, Fusarium and Cylindrocarpon Furthermore, the total ginsenosides and diverse monomer ginsenosides present in the roots of intercropped ginseng exhibited varying degrees of enhancement. The results of the analyses indicated that the observed increase in ginsenoside content under intercropping was attributable to interactions between soil microorganisms, including the Prevotella_7, Penicillium, Humicola and Deconica, and soil factors such as SOM, NH4+\u2013N, AP and S-UE.

The contents of the following antioxidant compounds were assessed: indole derivatives (6-methyl-D,L-tryptophan, tryptophan), ergothioneine, and phenolic acid (p-hydroxybenzoic acid), as well as lovastatin and ergosterol. The addition of oxybenzone negatively affected biomass growth, reducing it from 3.205 \u00b1 0.4022 g to 0.5803 \u00b1 0.1019 g. A considerable reduction in oxybenzone amounts was found in the medium after incubation (from 25 mg to 0.2993 \u00b1 0.1934 mg). After lyophilization, the mycelium contained 1.1591 \u00b1 0.0323 mg of oxybenzone. Additionally, eleven biotransformation products were assessed in the mycelium and medium samples using UPLC-Q ToF. After incubation, the transformation products were identified based on monoisotopic molecular mass and fragmentation spectra. The observed increase in the content of some antioxidants, e.g., ergothioneine, while reducing the content of others, such as lovastatin, suggests that the impact of xenobiotics on the antioxidant profile of in vitro cultures of L. edodes is complex. Marked alterations in biomass growth suggest a potential toxicological risk associated with oxybenzone. This study contributes to the understanding of the environmental impact of UV filters and emphasizes the need for safer alternatives.", "venue": "Toxics", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "1403638923", "name": "A.

The disease is endemic to Africa and affects oil palm production there. Limited Fusarium wilt outbreaks have occurred in South America, but the disease has not yet been reported in South\u2010East Asia. An earlier review of Foe in 2006 provided updates on symptoms, spread and the difficulty in managing the disease. This paper updates our knowledge of oil palm, socio\u2010economic and environmental impacts of cultivation, Fusarium wilt disease epidemiology, Foe detection techniques, disease management strategies and biosecurity perspectives. Breeding for tolerant plant materials has significantly advanced in Africa, but financial constraints in several countries have limited the production of tolerant oil palm seed materials. Other emerging technologies for Foe control are also presented here, acknowledging the specific challenges to help inform the oil palm industry. We highlight the need to strengthen biosecurity plans in disease\u2010free regions. In these countries/regions that are currently free from the pathogen but cultivating susceptible plant materials, biosecurity protocols are essential to reduce threat of disease introduction and spread.

Despite their widespread occurrence and detailed morphological documentation, their microbial origins, formation mechanisms and ecological roles remain enigmatic. This review consolidates current knowledge on reticulated filaments, and addresses theoretical and scientific gaps on these intricate microbial structures, highlighting the association of reticulated filaments with biomineralization processes and the potential involvement of rare or uncultivated microbial taxa. Variations in sheath composition and size suggest the involvement of multiple microbial groups, potentially including bacteria, archaea and fungi.

They are mostly found in tropical to subtropical or temperate rainforests. Many phenotype-based species are considered as pantropical or even sub-cosmopolitan, either attributed to old ages, having existed prior to continental breakups or long-distance dispersal. We built a much expanded, global phylogeny of Gomphillaceae, the most diverse group of leaf-dwelling lichenised fungi. Our sampling encompassed six major biodiversity hotspots: MIOI (Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands), the Caribbean, New Caledonia, the Colombian Choc\u00f3, Mesoamerica and the Atlantic coast of Brazil. It was based on multilocus sequence data (mtSSU rDNA, nuLSU rDNA and RPB1), including 2207 sequences of 1256 specimens. Species delimitation methods combined with a phenotype matrix identified 473 putative species. Amongst these, 104 are confirmed as described, 213 are classified as cryptic or near cryptic (hidden diversity), 100 represent new species to science (identified on the basis of phenotype) and 56 remain unidentified. Amongst the 104 species with a valid name, 40.5% are distributed across 2\u20135 continents (lichenogeographical regions) by applying the phenotype-based species concept. However, using the integrative approach to delineate species, this estimate is reduced to 9%. We estimate the global species richness of Gomphillaceae at 1,861\u20132,356 species. The timing of species-level divergences suggests that the current distribution of foliicolous lichens is shaped more by long-distance dispersal and rapid diversification than by vicariance. The origin of the family and major clades appears to be in the Neotropics, with subsequent numerous dispersal events.

In this study, Trichoderma afroharzianum T22 colonized the roots of garden pea cultivars exposed to alkali-mediated Fe-deficiency in a host- specific manner. In Fe-deficient Sugar Snap, T22 improved growth parameters consistent with increased tissue Fe and rhizosphere siderophore. The split-root assay demonstrated that the beneficial effects of T22 on Fe deficiency mitigation are the result of a whole-plant association rather than localized root-specific effects. RNA-seq analysis showed 575 and 818 differentially expressed genes upregulated and downregulated in the roots inoculated with T22 under Fe deficiency. The upregulated genes were mostly involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (monooxygenase activity, ammonia-lyase activity, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase), along with genes related to mineral transport and redox homeostasis. Further, a flavonoid precursor restored plant health even in the absence of T22, confirming the role of microbial symbiosis in mitigating Fe deficiency. Interestingly, T22 restored the abundance of rhizobia, particularly Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium indicum, along with the induction of NifA, NifD, and NifH in nodules, suggesting a connection between T22 and rhizobia under Fe-starvation. Further, the elevated rhizosphere siderophore, root flavonoid, expression of PsCoA (4-coumarate-CoA ligase) as well as the relative abundance of TaAOX1 and R. leguminosarum diminished when T22 was substituted with exogenous Fe. This suggests that exogenous Fe eliminates the need for microbiome-driven Fe mobilization, while T22-mediated Fe mitigation depends on flavonoid- driven symbiosis and R. leguminosarum abundance. It was further supported by the positive interaction of T22 on R. leguminosarum growth in Fe-deficient media. Thus, the beneficial effect of T22 on rhizobia likely stems from their interactions, not just improved Fe status in plants. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into T22 interactions with host and rhizobia, advancing microbiome strategies to alleviate Fe deficiency in peas and other legumes.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "2311683176", "name": "Asha Thapa"}, {"authorId": "2289931386", "name": "Md Rokibul Hasan"}, {"authorId": "2266634861", "name": "Ahmad H.

Microbial biomarkers were extracted from the soil profiles and used to measure microbial diversity and microbial community composition (using 16S rRNA). Vegetation restoration, soil depth, and their interaction with each other significantly affected the MRC, fungal residue carbon (FRC), and bacterial residue carbon (BRC) contents. The MRC content tended to increase across the four vegetation restoration patterns in the following order: CK (323.25\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121)\u2009<\u2009orchard (1035.67\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121)\u2009<\u2009restored forest (2919.01\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121)\u2009<\u2009secondary forest (6556.72\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121).

Homologues of the L. maculans AvrLm3 AVR protein, a LARS family member, have been identified in other fungal species, including an AVR protein from Fulvia fulva called Ecp11-1. We have previously shown that Ecp11-1 is recognized by rapeseed varieties carrying the Rlm3 R gene, and that this recognition is masked by the presence of another LARS AVR gene, AvrLm4-7. In this study, we expanded our characterization of the Rlm3 resistance spectrum to putative effectors from Fusarium oxysporum and Zymoseptoria ardabiliae and showed that one effector from F. oxysporum f. sp. narcissi behaves like Ecp11-1, being recognized by Rlm3, and this recognition also being masked by the presence of AvrLm4-7. We finally investigated which protein regions and amino acids were necessary for the recognition of AvrLm3 and Ecp11-1 by Rlm3. This analysis is a first step towards the identification or engineering of broad- spectrum R proteins that confer protection against multiple phytopathogens through the recognition of structural effector families.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2025-02-07", "authors": [{"authorId": "108204912", "name": "N.

Their production through enzymatic hydrolysis has gained relevance by converting agro-industrial waste into fermentable sugars and residual oils, which are essential for the generation of bioethanol and biodiesel. The fungus Aspergillus stands out as a key source of enzymes, including cellulases, xylanases, amylases, and lipases, which are crucial for the breakdown of biomass and oils to produce bioethanol and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). This review examines the current state of these technologies, highlighting the significance of Aspergillus in the conversion of energy-rich waste materials. While the process holds significant potential, it faces challenges such as the high costs associated with enzymatic production and final processing stages. Agro-industrial waste is proposed as an energy resource to support a circular economy, thereby eliminating reliance on non-renewable resources in these processes. Furthermore, advanced pretreatment technologies\u2014including biological, physical, and physicochemical methods, as well as the use of ionic liquids\u2014are explored to enhance process efficiency. Innovative technologies, such as genetic engineering of Aspergillus strains and enzyme encapsulation, promise to optimize sustainable biofuel production by addressing key challenges and advancing this technology towards large-scale implementation.", "venue": "Fermentation", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2343940432", "name": "Fernando Enrique Rosas-Vega"}, {"authorId": "2303197615", "name": "Roberta Pozzan"}, {"authorId": "1411940363", "name": "W.

This study aimed to assess the exposure of waste workers to mycotoxins through a human biomonitoring study.A total of 33 workers and 19 controls provided spot urine samples to determine 10 mycotoxins\u2019 urinary biomarkers using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Risk characterization was performed using hazard quotient and margin of exposure assessments.The results indicated that workers were exposed to six out of the 10 mycotoxins tested, with the following detection rates: deoxynivalenol (91%, 30/33), ochratoxin A (33%, 11/33), zearalenone (17%, 5/33), \u03b1-zearalenol (12%, 4/33), \u03b2-zearalenol (12%, 4/33), and HT-2 toxin (3%, 1/33). Within controls and outwith controls, were exposed to 5/10 and 2/10 mycotoxins, respectively. All participants exhibited hazard quotients for deoxynivalenol and zearalenone below one, indicating that the exposure is unlikely to pose a health risk. However, when considering the margin of exposure determined for ochratoxin A, 18% of the total participants presented results below 200 for non-neoplastic effects, and 100% of the total participants presented values below 10,000 for neoplastic effects, suggesting potential health concerns that require further assessment.This study highlights the need for future research on occupational exposure to mycotoxins in waste management settings.", "venue": "Frontiers in Public Health", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-13", "authors": [{"authorId": "2346477395", "name": "Carla Martins"}, {"authorId": "144133864", "name": "C.
