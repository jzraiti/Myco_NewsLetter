        "abstract": "The laccase activity changes of the Auricularia cornea var. Li strain were studied over a continuous 9-day period using different carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and lignocellulose as liquid fermentation inducers. The results showed that the addition of carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and alkaline lignin all stimulated Auricularia cornea var. Li to secrete laccase and promoted the accumulation of mycelial biomass. Both carbon and nitrogen deficiencies could stimulate Auricularia cornea var. Li to produce more laccase, but they were detrimental to the accumulation of mycelial biomass. Maltose and peptone should be prioritized as materials for cultivating high-laccase-producing Auricularia cornea var. Li strains through liquid fermentation. Lignocellulosic biomass could significantly enhance laccase activity in Auricularia cornea var. Li. During the cultivation of Auricularia cornea var. Li., wheat bran and cottonseed hulls that produced high levels of laccase should be recommended. This study partially revealed the laccase production characteristics of Auricularia cornea var. Li and identified culture substances that were beneficial for laccase secretion during different growth stages of the mushroom. The results provide a foundation for improving the yield and quality of Auricularia cornea var. Li.",

        "title": "Spore-Derived Isolates from a Single Basidiocarp of Bioluminescent Omphalotus olivascens Reveal Multifaceted Phenotypic and Physiological Variations",
        "abstract": "The fungal genus Omphalotus is noted for its bioluminescence and the production of biologically active secondary metabolites. We isolated 47 fungal strains of Omphalotus olivascens germinated from spores of a single mushroom. We first noted a high degree of variation in the outward appearances in radial growth and pigmentation among the cultures. Radial growth rates fell into at least five distinct categories, with only slower-growing isolates obtained compared with the parental dikaryon. Scanning UV-vis spectroscopy of liquid-grown cultures showed variation in pigmentation in both the absorption intensity and peak absorption wavelengths, indicating that some isolates vary from the parental strain in both pigment concentration and composition. Bioluminescence intensity was observed to have isolates with both greater and lesser intensities, while the increased emission in response to caffeic acid was inversely proportional to the unstimulated output. Under UV illumination, the media of the parental strain was observed to be brightly fluorescent, which was not due to the pigment, while the isolates also varied from greater to lesser intensity and in their peak emission. At least three separate fluorescent bands were observed by gel electrophoresis from one of the cultures, while only one was observed in others. In a subset of the cultures, fluorescence intensity varied significantly in response to casamino acids. None of this subset produced an antibiotic effective against Staphylococcus aureus, and only the haploids, but not the parental heterokaryon, produced an antibiotic consistent with illudin M effective against Mycobacterium smegmatis. This same subset produced an anticancer agent that was highly potent against MDA-MB-468 breast cancer tumor cells. We interpret these variations in haploids as significant in altering Omphalotus physiology and its production of secondary metabolites, which may in turn alter their ecology and life cycle, and could be further applied to studying fungal physiologies and facilitate linking them to their genetic underpinnings.",

        "title": "Application of Urea Nanoparticles in Low\u2010Land Rice Fields to Boost Crop Production While Maintaining Soil Fertility and Rhizospheric Health",
        "abstract": "Nano\u2010fertilizers are becoming promising in developing novel fertilization strategies while reducing the requirements of traditional fertilizers. Nano\u2010fertilizers have high nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and are required in small doses as compared to bulk fertilizers. The use of nano fertilizers in conjunction with a reduced dose of traditional fertilizers improves nutrient availability to plants and minimizes leaching and environmental contamination. The impact of the application of such an integrated fertilization approach on the soil fertility and microbiological population also needs to be understood. The present study investigates the influence of seven field treatments, including biogenic urea nanoparticles, as a source of N nutrient developed by TERI (referred as Teri's nano urea [TNU]), with and without conventional urea in an integrated manner. These treatments include the following: (T1)\u2014100% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN), (T2)\u2014TNU alone, (T3) 100% RDN combined with TNU, (T4)\u2014TNU at 50% concentration alone, (T5)\u201475% RDN combined with TNU, (T6) 50% RDN combined with TNU, and (T7) 50% RDN alone. RDF for N, P, and K used in the experiment is 140\u00a0kg/ha of urea for nitrogen fertilizer, 60\u00a0kg/ha of phosphorus, and 70\u00a0kg/ha of potassium in accordance with the local agronomic guidelines. A variable amount of urea was applied in different treatments but the recommended dose of phosphorous and potash fertilizers was applied consistently across the treatments. In different treatments, urea nanoparticles were applied as a nitrogen source via root dipping and foliar spray. The study also incorporates the economics of using nanoparticles to supplement nitrogen in an additive manner along with non\u2010nano macronutrient sources. Further, the influence of this novel approach of fertilization was also evaluated on the native microorganism species found in the rice fields. The results for the evaluated growth parameters, yield parameters, microbial population of soil, plant uptake, and cost economics suggest that at least 25% of the conventional urea requirement can be substituted with urea nanoparticles without causing harm to the bacterial and mycological species found in the rice agricultural fields.",

        "abstract": "Oyster mushroom is one type of exotic plant that has high economic value and great potential to be developed commercially. The current economic condition of mushroom cultivation is not supported by the availability of adequate investment capital and limited human resources in the oyster mushroom sector. In addition, oyster mushroom cultivation requires special skills and supporting technology. Increasingly developing technology provides more choices in technology development, especially in the field of oyster mushroom cultivation. PLC Outseal is one alternative in the development of oyster mushroom cultivation technology. PLC Outseal was chosen because it is cheap and has been proven reliable in the industrial world. Controlling room temperature 22 - 28 \u2103 and humidity 60 - 80% in oyster mushroom cultivation is very important for the success of oyster mushroom cultivation. In this study, the use of the LM35 sensor with ladder plc outseal programming has an error of 1.3% when compared to the HTC-1 digital thermometer and the humidity sensor has an error of 0.69% when compared to the SM150T. The use of RS 485 in communication up to 110 m between slaves has no obstacles and is very stable in testing between slave plc outseal. Node RED as an IoT (Internet of Things) platform is very good for monitoring the temperature and humidity of the growing media in mushroom cultivation.",

        "abstract": "Calocybe indica known as a milky white, indigenous and medicinally important edible mushroom. The cultural conditions, molecular identification, and phylogenetic relationships of selected strains of Calocybe indica were examined. The optimal temperature for mycelial development was found to be 30\u00b0C, whereas the lowest growth occurred at 15\u00b0C. The most favorable growth occurs at a pH of 5. Based on the growth characteristics of various culture media, potato dextrose agar proved to be the most advantageous, while Hennerberg and Czapek Dox media were less suitable. Molecular identification and the phylogenetic relationships of the chosen IUM strains of C. indica were examined through their ITS and RAPD analyses. The selected strains of C. indica had total sequence lengths of ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rDNA ranging from 570 to 620 bp. The sizes of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions vary among strains, with ITS2 showing greater variety than ITS1. All strains contained identical 5.8S rDNA sequences, according to sequencing analysis. Eleven out of the twenty arbitrary 10-base oligonucleotide primers utilized to amplify genomic DNA segments for the chosen C. indica strains were effective. RAPD-PCR resulted in distinct multiple products, demonstrating significant variability among the strains assessed. The quantity of amplified bands differed based on the primers utilized or the strains evaluated. The DNA polymorphisms displayed consistent traits in the replicated trials. Thus, it can be concluded that ITS sequencing and RAPD methods were effective in identifying the genetic diversity of the chosen strains of Calocybe indica.\nPlant Tissue Cult. & Biotech. 34(2): 205-216, 2024 (December)",

The Bumi Harmoni program, implemented by PT PLN NP UP Paiton, is one such initiative. This study aims to (1) analyze social innovations, (2) assess the program's impact on carbon sequestration, and (3) evaluate program performance. Data from 2021 to May 2024 were collected through interviews with group leaders, members, and CSR teams. A descriptive qualitative analysis and Social Return on Investment (SROI) methodology were employed. Results reveal social innovations, including seed banks, tree planting, organic waste utilization for maggot cultivation, and oyster mushroom cultivation. These initiatives address organic waste management, improve community economics, and contribute to carbon sequestration. The program achieved carbon sequestration of 357.79 tons of CO2 gg e, with potential for carbon tax conversion. The SROI analysis yielded a value of 1.82, indicating positive social returns. However, challenges may arise in maintaining seed bank health and managing waste utilization processes. The study demonstrates the program's potential to solve environmental and economic issues while generating measurable social impact.

        "abstract": "Waste sustainable management involves both minimizing their quantity by improving technological processes and using waste as resources. A large amount of solid organic waste from confectionery industries contains food elements that can be used as additives in compound feeds production. This reduces compound feeds cost without losing their quality, and also provides for the secondary use of solid organic waste from confectionery industries, which corresponds to the generally accepted waste management hierarchy. The main limiting factor for this waste type using in compound feeds is mold fungi rapid development, which is due, among other things, to an increase in the waste humidity when stored in an open manner at industrial sites. \nThe aim of the work was to research developed integrated approach effectiveness to increase the shelf life without the mold fungi appearance for solid organic waste from confectionery industries. \nThe following research methods were used in the work: field \u2013 to observe the mold fungi development in real storage conditions of solid organic waste from confectionery industries in an open way; laboratory \u2013 to determine the moisture content of waste at different times according to DSTU 4910:2008 and sanitary and mycological waste assessment. \nThe use of the simplest measures to reduce the atmospheric contact precipitation with solid organic waste from confectionery industries \u2013 canopies \u2013 allows us to increase the period until the mold fungi appearance by 20 or more days, depending on the waste composition. Faster mold fungi development is characteristic of waste that contains more than 50 % wafers with fat filling. Solid organic waste from confectionery industries treatment with humic acids alkaline solution obtained from brown coal increases the period until the mold fungi appearance by an average of 50 days. The two methods combination is effective for increasing the shelf life of solid organic waste from confectionery industries before their use in compound feeds. Thus, it is possible to increase the share such waste use in compound feeds. \nThe proposed integrated approach to increasing the shelf life of solid organic waste from confectionery industries allows to increase the waste share that is suitable for secondary use in compound feeds. The humic acids alkaline solutions using as a bactericidal measure for solid organic waste from confectionery industries is justified from the sustainable approach for brown coal using, allows to increase the nutritional value of the final compound feeds and reduces energy costs for mold fungi elimination.",

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is widely applied to detect different chemical compounds in organic matter and create label-free high-resolution maps on the level of separate cells. The main advantage of this technique is the possibility to study objects in vivo without special pretreatment. However, it is rarely used to determine ratios between different substances or to perform deep quantitative analysis of the obtained spectra. In our study, we derive ratiometric equations that allow estimating the mass concentrations of triacylglycerols, proteins, sugars, polysaccharides, and DNA. We show that it is possible to determine average unsaturation and chain length from the spectra of lipids and concentrations of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan from the spectra of proteins. We apply the derived equations to the Raman spectra of fungal spores of over 70 different species of macrofungi. We provide detailed characterization of lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides, which are contained in the spores. We believe that our study not only provides new fundamental knowledge in the field of mycology but also can become a basis for spectral quantification of any organic material, and our approach can be applied, for instance, to food diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The cultivation of white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) generates significant quantities of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), a byproduct traditionally treated as waste despite its nutrient- and organic-carbon-rich composition. The EU-funded project FER-PLAY identified SMS as one of the most promising circular fertilizers (i.e., those produced from waste streams, transforming them into value-added products). Within the project, a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) analysis of SMS were conducted with a cradle-to-gate-to-grave scope across three European regions, comparing it to a non-renewable mix with equivalent N, P, K, and C inputs. The LCA results reveal substantial environmental benefits of SMS over the non-renewable baseline, particularly in land use, fossil resource depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change, which together account for 98% of total impacts. Although SMS exhibits higher water consumption, it represents only 2% of total impacts. LCC highlights the critical effects of fresh mushroom substrate composition on yield, economies of scale, and revenue generation. Overall, this study highlights the significant environmental and economic potential of repurposing SMS as a soil improver, offering a compelling case for its integration into agricultural systems as part of a sustainable, circular economy.",

        "abstract": "Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is an important plantation crop in Indonesia including in Riau Province. Palm oil productivity in Riau has decreased due to several factors, one of which is disease. An important disease in\u00a0 palm oil plantations is stem base rot (BPB) caused by the fungus Ganoderma sp. This study aims to identify the causes of BPB disease of palm oil in Deli Makmur Village, Kampar Regency and Jati Baru Village, Siak Regency. This research was conducted using survey and observation methods in palm oil plantations in two villages in Kampar and Siak Districts. The identification of pathogens was carried out based on morphological characteristics by making macroscopic and microscopic observations. Initial diagnosis based on symptoms and signs palm oil plants found in Deli Makmur Village and in Jati Baru Village showed symptoms of stem base rot (BPB). The results of morphological identification show that the pathogen causing BPB disease is Ganoderma sp. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the two Ganoderma sp. fungal isolates are slightly different, where the fungal isolate from Deli Makmur Village mycelium grows sideways, has a smooth and very thick texture, there are concentric rings, crystals and cuticular cells. While the mushroom isolate from Jati Baru Village mycelium grows sideways, has a fine texture, is quite thick, and there are no ring-shaped concentric, crystals and cuticular cells.",

        "abstract": "Russula Pers. (Basidiomycota) is recognized as one of the most widely distributed macrofungi globally. This genus includes several edible species with distinct color variations, such as R. cyanoxantha. However, in Indonesia, knowledge of this species remains limited as colourful mushrooms are often mistakenly considered poisonous. During a fungus expedition in Southeast Sulawesi, we collected a green edible wild mushroom consumed by locals. Our study aimed to verify the taxonomic classification of our specimens through morphological and molecular analysis. The fresh basidiomata were examined based on their macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Molecular analysis using ITS 1/2 sequences was conducted to construct a phylogenetic tree. Our findings identified the green mushroom as R. cyanoxantha (Schaeff.) Fr. (Synonym: R. lilacina). Morphologically, our specimens can be distinguished from R. virescens by their smooth cap. They differ from R. aeruginea and R. heterophylla by having flexible, persistent gills. Additionally, our R. cyanoxantha specimen BO24636 can be separated from R. dinghuensis and R. subpallidirosea by their forked gills near the stalk. A BLAST comparison revealed a 96% similarity to R. lilacina from Thailand as the closest match. The phylogenetic tree (Maximum Likelihood) placed our specimens within the R. lilacina group (BS value 99%). Our research contributes to the taxonomic understanding of this edible wild green macrofungi in Indonesia, and future studies should explore its nutritional composition.",

The people of the area are mainly agriculturalist, but fishing is the major activity taking place around the reservoir. Wtaer samples were collected monthly from February-April and June-August 2020. Spatially the data were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and temporally using independent t-test. Findings on the mycological study shows that the yeast count range between 9.42\u00b13.91 and 18.38\u00b11.04 (106 CFU/ml) while the mold count range between 5.20\u00b11.74 and 7.58\u00b11.97 (107 CFU/ml) in various sampling sites. The order of the occurrence of fungal isolates across the various sampling sites was Aspergillus niger (30.23%), Cladosporium sp. (25.58%), Aspergillus flavus (16.28%), Penicillium sp. (16.28%) and Fusarium sp. (11.63%). The prevalence of these pathogenic fungi in the water could affect fish growth. Hence, there should be adequate sensitization to educate households and farmers bordering the reservoir on the danger associated with loading the reservoir with waste materials.",

        "abstract": "Termitomyces mushrooms, known for their symbiotic relationship with termites and their high nutritional and medicinal value, are challenging to cultivate artificially due to their specific growth requirements. This study investigates the impact of arginine on the mycelial growth, development, and lignocellulolytic capabilities of Termitomyces. We found that arginine significantly promoted conidia formation, altered mycelial morphology, and enhanced biomass and polysaccharide content. The addition of arginine also upregulated the expression of the enzymes related to lignocellulose decomposition, leading to increased activities of cellulase, hemicellulase, and laccase, which accelerated the decomposition and utilization of corn straw. A transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression patterns of carbohydrate-active enzyme genes in arginine-supplemented Termitomyces mycelia, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these enhancements. The GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis highlighted the role of arginine in transmembrane transport, fatty acid oxidation, and carbohydrate metabolism. This study offers a molecular basis for the observed phenotypic changes and valuable insights for developing optimal culture strategies for Termitomyces, potentially enhancing its artificial cultivation and application in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste.",

This study analyzes metropolitan households' consumption behaviors regarding Non-timber forest products (NTFP) and agricultural products using agri-food consumer panel data from the Rural Development Administration (2010-2021). We examine demographic differences in purchase preferences, focusing on shiitake mushrooms, persimmons, and chestnuts, which have high household purchase frequency. Findings show that raw NTFP account for less than 3% of total grocery consumption, which is lower than that of agricultural products. While the consumption of processed agricultural products has increased steadily, the consumption of processed NTFP has remained stagnant at below 1% over 12 years. Preferences for shiitake mushrooms varied significantly by age and household income, for persimmons by age and household size, and for chestnuts by household size and income. These results inform strategies and policy recommendations to promote NTFP consumption.",

        "abstract": "\u00a0\nAmong the cultivated mushrooms, Pleurotus spp. occupies an important place and is being produced on a large scale, globally. In terms of mushroom output, India is still increasing at a very moderate rate of 4.3 per cent. One of the major reasons responsible for such slow growth rate is the dipteran fly, Bradysia tritici (Coquillett). In this light, present study was conducted to check the susceptibility level of different Pleurotus spp. against B. tritici and the effect of organic products viz., Cow urine, Panchgavya, Jeevamrit and Dashgavya for the management of this pest. Among the four Pleurotus species screened against B. tritici, all were found to be vulnerable; P. cornucopiae being the most susceptible followed by P. florida, P. ostreatus and P. sajor caju. Out of the organic products, dashgavya at 10 per cent was the only suitable product which not only reduced the insect population but also improved the mushroom yields. Therefore, keeping in view the environment safety and crop yield, preventive spray of dashgavya can be given to manage this pest. Additionally, as a part of integrated pest management, these low-cost organic solutions can be tested in turn benefiting the mushroom industry.\u00a0",

        "title": "Chemical profiling and characterisation of anthraquinone\u2010based polyphenols as biocolourants from Cortinarius semisanguineus",
        "abstract": "Anthraquinone dyes are known for their significant colour (brightness of shade in the red, blue and green areas) and light fastness properties compared with other synthetic dyes (such as azo\u2010based dyes). However, challenging multi\u2010step synthesis of anthraquinones and limited access to fewer substituents result in insufficient reactivity, hindering their wider industrial applications. Therefore, seeking highly substituted anthraquinone\u2010based colourants from natural sources is gaining interest among researchers. Notably, certain species of Dermocybe mushrooms are recognised for their red gills rich in anthraquinone colourants, which have been studied. However, limited knowledge of the chemotaxonomic characteristics of their species and molecular structure hinders wide use of their commercial applications. Our study screened extraction methods for their selectivity towards specific anthraquinone types, such as glycosidic vs non\u2010glycosidic, or those with carboxylic acid groups vs those without. In our observation, a sequential extraction strategy, starting with aqueous buffer extract followed by acetone extract, selectively yielded carboxylic acid\u2010containing anthraquinones and non\u2010carboxylic acid\u2010containing anthraquinones, respectively. We carried out a detailed analysis of anthraquinone\u2010based colourants in Cortinarius semisanguineus, comparing MS1\u2010MS2 profiles with two other species of the Dermocybe fungus group (Cortinarius sanguineus and Cortinarius ominosus), highlighting key interspecies differences in expressing certain anthraquinones or regioisomers. This study led to the structural identification of eleven natural anthraquinones and their glycosidic forms among these species. The carboxylic anthraquinones identified and characterised by their fragmentation pattern using MS1\u2010MS2 profiles include dermolutein, dermorubin, chlorodermorubin, endocrocin and chlorodermolutein, while the non\u2010carboxylic anthraquinones, primarily from the acetone extract, were dermoglaucin, emodin and dermocybin.",

        "abstract": "White button mushrooms are an important crop globally, and due to the role of peat in current cultivation practices, the industry is under increasing pressure to find suitable alternatives. Peat functions as \u201ccasing\u201d, a surface layer that, amongst other functions, provides available water to the fungal mycelium and is considered essential for mushroom growth. This research aimed to determine the potential of bark as an alternative casing material and its suitability for commercial mushroom production. Two experiments were conducted, comparing two types of commercially available peat casing with bark-based casings. The bark casing in Experiment A was found to be statistically similar to the peat casing in terms of yield and quality. The two bark casings in Experiment B failed to produce a 1st flush of mushrooms, and total yields were significantly lower compared to the peat casings, highlighting the fact that the consistency of the bark material across both experiments was variable. There were several issues associated with the bark casing, which included water stress and cropping delays, all of which would be unacceptable from a commercial perspective. Further research is required to refine bark-based casing, focusing on a better consistency of the bark feedstock and reduction of contamination risk. This work contributes to ongoing research and development to address the dependency of mushroom production on peat.",

Due to their saprophytic nature, they produce enzymes that act on the substrate in which they grow, degrading lignocellulosic material such as wood, forest and agricultural residues, hardwoods, wood by-products, cereal straw, bagasse, etc., and thanks to this degradative capacity, their enzymes are used in a wide range of biotechnological and environmental applications. In order to increase their production and consumption not only for their nutritional qualities, but also for their nutraceutical and biotechnological qualities, ease of cultivation, low investment cost, etc., new ways are being sought to increase their performance in cultivation. Recently, research has expanded the search for alternative uses of the Pleurotus genus, which has led to an increase in its cultivation, as well as its application in different fields of biotechnology. The cultivation of Pleurotus mushrooms represents an opportunity to generate a sustainable process and incorporate the process into a circular economy, generating environmental, social and economic benefits. The use of agro-industrial substrates and the subsequent reuse of the spent substrate as compost or organic fertilizer reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and minimizes methane production. This allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly production model. Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies for the promotion, marketing and sustainable production of products derived from these fungi.",

        "title": "Mushroom production, research and market in Pakistan",
        "abstract": "Mushroom is extensively produced for human consumption in many nations, including Pakistan due to their high protein and vitamin content. Pakistan boasts a high diversity of mushrooms because of its harsh geographical conditions and seasonal variations. Due to the plentiful supply of agro-wastes that make mushroom production possible, mushroom manufacturing is one of Pakistan\u2019s most potential cottage industries. The most popular commercially produced mushroom species are Oyster, Straw, and Button mushrooms; however, the most common and best-selling variety is the white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). This review article\u2019s objective is to gather information regarding Pakistan\u2019s mushroom production. Despite an increase in mushroom production, there are some issues that mushroom producers face during production and marketing that need to be resolved for further development of this sector. In light of the nation\u2019s land scarcity and high unemployment rate, boosting mushroom production may be a viable strategy for boosting the rural economy. The growth of this industry would also enhance the variety of company ventures and job prospects in semi-urban and rural regions.",

        "abstract": "Walnuts are prone to contamination by rotting fungi. However, the microflora present in walnuts across various regions of China has not been thoroughly investigated. Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) is commonly used in food preservation because of its natural safety and strong antimicrobial properties. Additionally, studies on the antifungal potential of CEO to prevent walnut spoilage are limited. Therefore, we investigated Aspergillus spp. contamination in moldy walnuts stored across different locations in Shanxi, China. A total of 100 moldy walnut samples underwent traditional mycological analysis to isolate Aspergillus spp. The antibacterial properties and the mechanisms by which CEO targets Aspergillus spp. were thoroughly investigated. Five representative morphospecies were subsequently classified to the species level using Internal Transcribed Spacer sequence analysis. The dominant species were Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus, with frequencies of 100% and 93%, respectively, followed by Aspergillus nigers, Aspergillus terreus, and Aspergillus tubingensis, with frequencies of 78%, 47%, and 40%, respectively. Overall, 358 fungal species belonging to the Aspergillus genus were recovered. The MIC of CEO against A. flavus in vitro was 0.78 g/L. Furthermore, CEO compromised the permeability and integrity of the cell membrane, causing the leakage of intracellular components and promoting the accumulation of malondialdehyde compounds and a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity. Overall, we isolated and identified Aspergillus spp. in moldy walnuts and confirmed the feasibility of using CEO as a green anti-Aspergillus spp. agent for the preservation of walnuts.",

        "abstract": "Mushrooms are a plant-based food source with considerable potential and are often found around us. However, some types of mushrooms have similar characteristics and morphology. Based on these problems, an application is made that aims as a medium for the introduction of mushroom types through the use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology. By utilizing Augmented Reality as an interactive educational media, it is expected to facilitate users in obtaining information about the type of fungus accompanied by visualization in the form of 3D objects. The research method used consists of three stages, namely data collection, multimedia product creation, and evaluation. This mushroom type learning application is made using AR marker based on tracking technology with the MDLC (Multimedia Development Life Cycle) method according to Luther Sutopo. Based on the results of Black Box testing, angle, distance and light intensity testing, the application can function properly. Evaluation using the System Usability Scale (SUS) was conducted on the general public with an age range of 17-45 years in RW 05 Panyingkiran Village, Indihiang District, Tasikmalaya City with a population of 356 people, determining the number of respondents using the slovin formula which is 32 people. The test results show that the application obtained an average score of 74.78, which indicates that the application is in the \u201cAcceptable\u201d category for Acceptability Range, Grade C in Grade Scale, and \u201cGood\u201d in Adjective Rating.",

        "abstract": "Single-spore isolation is a fundamental technique for exploring genetic diversity in fungi, particularly in heterothallic species like Pleurotus ostreatus. This study outlines a method for isolating single spores from fruiting bodies, aimed at facilitating genetic improvement of mushrooms. The approach is especially suitable for the laboratories of mushrooms which are not necessarily well-funded, requiring only basic laboratory equipment. It is simple, resistant to contamination, and highly efficient. Under sterile conditions, spores were collected from mature mushroom fruiting bodies using a sterilized cotton swab and subjected to serial dilutions in distilled water. Each dilution was plated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and then incubated, producing a consistent source of genetically uniform mycelium for further study. Further, microscopic examinations revealed the presence of clamp connections, specialized structures that ensure genetic stability and facilitate cell division during hyphal growth. This method is broadly applicable, though fungi that do not germinate on artificial media may require an alternative approach.\nRes. Agric. Livest. Fish. Vol. 11, No. 3, December 2024: 383-388",

Seven treatments were evaluated using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD), comprising combinations of coconut coir, rice husk, sugarcane bagasse, and biochar.\u00a0Key findings reveal that treatments combining SMS, sugarcane bagasse, and either coconut coir or biochar (T6 and T7) achieved significantly higher survival rates and Dickson Quality Index (DQI) scores compared to conventional soil (T1). These treatments provided favorable chemical properties, including optimal pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrient content (N, P, K), which are critical for cocoa seedling development. The results suggest that using SMS with agricultural waste as an alternative germination medium can reduce cultivation costs, enhance seedling growth, and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices by repurposing organic waste. This approach not only offers cost-effective benefits for farmers but also mitigates environmental impacts associated with waste disposal.",

        "title": "Mycoremediation of Louisiana sweet crude oil with Pleurotus ostreatus and nutrient amendments",
        "abstract": "\n Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are known to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in petroleum crude oil, making them candidates for oil spill remediation studies. This work aimed to assess P. ostreatus for its hydrocarbon degradation potential in estuarine conditions. In vitro experiments evaluated nutrient amendments based on P. ostreatus carbon: nitrogen: phosphorous (C: N: P) ratios to optimize mycelium growth, increase degradation efficiencies, and reduce potential nutrient run-off in broader applications. Image analysis was used to track mycelium growth response to various salinities, nutrient amendments, and oil types. Subsequent evaluation of alterations within the saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) fractions constituting Louisiana Sweet Crude (LSC) were conducted via SARA analysis. Results indicate that P. ostreatus mycelium tolerates estuarine salinities, with maximum growth between 5-15 \u2030. Relative to 0 \u2030, growth was reduced at salinities >25 \u2030, but positive growth was still observed. Nutrient amendments significantly increased growth over seven days relative to untreated samples (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The combination of ammonium chloride and potassium phosphate yielded optimal mycelium growth after 7\u2009days. Mycelium and nutrients significantly altered saturate (p\u2009=\u20090.0015) and asphaltene (p\u2009=\u20090.0124) fractions in LSC. This study suggests that mycelium growth is viable under estuarine salinities and can be enhanced with nutrient amendments. Introducing nutrient factors was shown to influence oil degradation. Results also indicate that mycelium can reduce recalcitrant oil fractions. Thus, this study highlights the adaptability of P. ostreatus to estuarine conditions and its response to nutrient amendments, all while offering a promising approach to crude oil bioremediation.",

        "abstract": "Iru, a traditional fermented condiment widely consumed in West Africa, is produced from the seeds of Parkia biglobosa (African locust bean) and Prosopis Africana (Mesquite/Okpehe). The quality and safety of Iru can be significantly affected by fungal contaminants during processing and storage. This study aims to compare the fungal contaminants present in Iru produced from Parkia biglobosa and Prosopis Africana, examining their impact on the nutritional and microbial quality of the final product. Standard mycological techniques were used to isolate and identify fungal species using Potato dextrose agar (PDA). The microbial load, proximate composition, and physicochemical properties of the samples were analysed to assess the quality and safety of the fermented products. Results showed that Parkia biglobosa Iru exhibited a higher diversity of fungal species compared to Prosopis Africana Iru. Aspergillus niger and Sacharomyces cerevisiae were the most prevalent with (23.81%) each while Penicillium chrysogenum has the least prevalence (1.0%). This diversity poses a greater risk of mycotoxin contamination in Iru from Parkia biglobosa. Both Prosopis Africana and Parkia bioglobosa offers significant nutritional benefits but Parkia generally has higher moisture content, protein and fat content while Prosopis contains higher fibre, ash content and carbohydrates which aids metabolic process overall nutritional value and energy source respectively.",

        "abstract": "In 1971 in the Perm region (the Russian Federation), three thermonuclear charges of the \u201cTaiga\u201d series were simultaneously detonated in order to test nuclear explosive technologies for creation of the Pechora-Kama canal. As a result of the underground explosions, long-lived technogenic radionuclides were released onto the surface of the earth along with soil and rock. Over time, a new forest ecosystem formed on the mound of the radioactively contaminated ground. The purpose of this study was to assess the 137Cs accumulation by woody plants and edible mushrooms at the \u201cTaiga\u201d underground nuclear explosions site at a remote stage (38 years) after radioactive contamination of the environment. Content of 137Cs was determined in organs of birch (Betula pubescens), spruce (Picea abies), aspen (Populus tremula), and pine (Pinus sylvestris), as well as in the fruiting bodies of mushrooms of the species Boletus edulis, Leccinum aurantiacum, Russula, and Suillus luteus. The activities of 137Cs in the samples were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry using a HPGe detector. The values of 137Cs activity concentration (on a dry weight basis) in the samples of wood, leaves/needles (1st year), and mushrooms were in the ranges of 0.5\u20136.8 Bq/kg, 54\u2013112 Bq/kg, and 212-3260 Bq/kg, respectively. Aggregated transfer coefficients (kg/m2) for the radionuclide in the biota species were calculated using these results and previously reported data on the density of soil contamination by 137Cs at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site. It has been found that the transfer coefficients of 137Cs from soil to biota for all studied species at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site are abnormally low compared to those obtained by many authors for other places of radioactive contamination, in particular for the areas contaminated by 137Cs as a result of the Chernobyl accident. Possible reasons for the low accumulation of 137Cs in the biota at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site are discussed.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n \nIn today\u2019s world, environmental sustainability and resource conservation have become major concerns globally. In general, logistics, and more specifically, transportation time, play a crucial role in decision-making aimed at reducing spoilage and related expenses. This study investigates how variations in transportation time impact inventory management costs in food waste recycling across three sectors: composting, mushroom cultivation, and insect farming. A synthetic dataset was created, simulating realistic scenarios in food waste management, including variables such as transportation time, type of waste, energy usage, seasonal variations, and inventory management costs. Computational models and statistical analyses, including moderation and mediation analyses, were conducted using R programming language to evaluate three hypotheses. The results indicate a marginal moderating impact of waste type, where perishable waste marginally increased the cost impact of transportation time without reaching conventional significance. Energy usage mediated the relationship, where increased transportation time correlated with increased energy use and costs. Seasonal variations moderated the relationship, especially in winter and summer, indicating enhanced sensitivity to transport time. \n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to conserve the rich biodiversity of wild mushrooms in Abongfen Forest by domesticating selected species for year-round availability and protection from extinction. Six mushrooms collected (Laetiporus sulphureus, Phellinus sp, Inonotus obliquus, Pleurotus sajor-caju, Stereum sp. and Pleurotus ostreatus) were cultured in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) to obtain pure cultures and mother spawn which was subsequently domesticated. Each mushroom species was cultivated in a completely randomized design with four treatments: sawdust (50%) mixed with maize cobs (50%), palm cones (100%), sawdust (100%) and beans straw (100%), all supplemented with rice brand (10%) and quick lime in eight replicates. Maize cobs were ground in an electric mill while palm cones and bean straws were reduced with a sharp knife to smaller sizes (1-3cm long) and soaked overnight in tap water. Excess water was drained using a sieve to 65% moisture content. Each portion was well mixed on a clean, cemented floor using a clean spade. 2.0 kg of each composition was filled into 25 x 15 cm polypropylene bags and sterilized in a drum for 4 hours. After cooling, each bag was inoculated with three table spoonsful of spawn, incubated at room temperature 25\u00b12 oC and the spawn run was observed until fully colonized. The days of colonization, primordial initiation and harvesting were noted. The fruit bodies on each bag were counted and weighed (g) after harvesting to determine the yield. Pleurotus sajor-caju, Pleurotus ostreatus and Laetiporus sulphureus colonized the substrate, but only Pleurotus grew and produced fruit bodies. Mycelial colonization was higher on beans straw (31.60 \u00b1 2.46 days). The mean diameter of pileus (24.70\u00b10.94 cm) and, average number of fruiting bodies (4.5\u00b11.2) and weight of fruit bodies (95.20 \u00b1 2.58 g) were best on maize cobs mixed with sawdust. Wild edible mushrooms need to be domesticated to ensure their availability for food and medicine and to provide a source of income.",

        "abstract": "\n Lentinan (LNT) is a polysaccharide from Shiitake mushrooms that has significant effects regarding antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory activities, etc., and this effect is influenced by the human intestinal flora. However, the interactions between LNT and human intestinal microorganisms, and their metabolic processes, remain unclear. In this study, the fermentation characteristics of LNT and its effects on intestinal flora and metabolites were studied by in vitro fermentation. Our results indicated that LNT was effectively utilised by intestinal microbiota, and the utilisation rate was 62.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0% after fermentation for 48\u00a0hr. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (mainly acetic acid and propionic acid) were increased to 4.157\u2009\u00b1\u20090.197 and 5.847\u2009\u00b1\u20090.283\u00a0mM, respectively. LNT also increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Parabacteroides, while reducing harmful bacteria like Veillonella and Klebsiella. Metabolomics and microbial correlation analysis revealed that the catabolism of LNT was also accompanied by amino acid catabolism, especially alanine, aspartic acid, glutamate, and the biosynthesis of adenosine 5\u2019-monophosphate, etc. These findings suggest that LNT can support gut health and demonstrates potential as a prebiotic.",

        "abstract": "Effective suppression of flammable liquid fires depends on the rapid formation of a closed water film by aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) over the oil surface. To investigate the mechanism of film formation on the oil surface with a compounded solution using the fluorocarbon betaine amphoteric surfactant (OC5-Betaine) as the active ingredient, a multi-angle visualization experiment was applied to capture the impact and spreading of the surfactant-laden droplets on a 25\u2009mm deep corn oil pool synchronously, within a Weber number (We) range of 7\u2013168. The results revealed that various characteristic impact phenomena strongly correlate with the We. The critical We for complete floating of a droplet or partial droplet sink to the bottom of oil pool after impact is approximately 155. There are two patterns, \u201cNipple\u201d and \u201cMushroom,\u201d when the droplet impacts the oil surface and sinks to the lowest point. When the We exceeds 90, the droplets consistently adopt the Mushroom shape. For a given We, the maximum depth and maximum penetration time of the Nipple type are greater than those of the Mushroom type. There is a high probability of \u201cRebound static\u201d phenomenon for the Nipple type, which slows spreading. A range of We between 90 and 140 promotes rapid droplet spreading and prevents jet breakup, making it optimal for firefighting. These findings offer insights for developing more effective AFFFs.",

        "abstract": "This research evaluates 20 advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for classifying mushroom diseases in Agaricus bisporus, utilizing a custom dataset of 3195 images (2464 infected and 731 healthy mushrooms) captured under uniform white-light conditions. The consistent illumination in the dataset enhances the robustness and practical usability of the assessed models. Using a weighted scoring system that incorporates precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and average precision (AP), ResNet-50 achieved the highest overall score of 99.70%, demonstrating outstanding performance across all disease categories. DenseNet-201 and DarkNet-53 followed closely, confirming their reliability in classification tasks with high recall and precision values. Confusion matrices and ROC curves further validated the classification capabilities of the models. These findings underscore the potential of CNN-based approaches for accurate and efficient early detection of mushroom diseases, contributing to more sustainable and data-driven agricultural practices.",

        "title": "Tetracycline Degradation by Persulfate Assisted by Fe and N Co-Doped Biochar Derived from Spent Mushroom Substrate for Sustainability: Effect of Pyrolysis Temperature",
        "abstract": "Mushroom production is increasing rapidly worldwide, raising public concern about the contamination effects of spent mushroom substrates (SMS). Preparation of Fe\u2013N-doped biochar (Fe-N-BC) from SMS as a raw material for catalytic degradation of antibiotics in water may be an effective and sustainable solid waste treatment. However, there is limited information available. This study investigated the effect and potential mechanism of SMS-based Fe-N-BC prepared at 300, 600, and 900 \u00b0C to catalyze persulfate (PS) for tetracycline (TC) removal. The results indicated that the catalytic performance of Fe-N-BC was significantly enhanced with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Notably, Fe-N-BC prepared at 900 \u00b0C exhibited high TC removal efficiency, with 95% TC removal at 120 min. This might be closely related to the fact that the Fe-N-BC prepared at high temperatures had more Fe oxides and active sites. Adsorption and radical and non-radical pathways were the main mechanisms for TC removal by Fe-N-BC/PS systems, especially the contribution of SO4\u00b7\u2212. By identifying the degradation products, three possible pathways of TC degradation were proposed, and the toxicity of the degradation intermediates was evaluated. The results of the reusability analysis indicated that the Fe-N-BC prepared at 900 \u00b0C had good potential for practical application, and the TC removal rate still reached 76%, even after five cycles. These findings provide valuable reference information for solid waste resources\u2019 sustainable utilization and the remediation of antibiotic-contaminated water.",

        "abstract": "Mold contamination, particularly from green and orange molds, poses a serious threat during the growing stage in mushroom cultivation, exacerbated throughout the hot and humid summer months. Despite extensive studies on green mold, orange mold remains underexplored. Consequently, this study comprehensively investigated orange mold contamination, focusing on identifying the causal agent, assessing its pathogenicity, and exploring potential countermeasures.Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing was used to confirm the causative entity, while the dual confrontation plate method was employed to assess pathogenicity. Furthermore, control strategies, including plant extract, in vitro media performance, and substrate characteristics, were explored. For estimated substrate qualities, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, along with analysis of physicochemical properties including the C:N ratio, carbon, protein, and mineral content were assessed.The result confirmed Neurospora sitophila as the causal entity. The pathogenicity assessments indicated that this mold impedes the colonization of mushroom mycelium by competing for nutrients and space. The in-vitro studies of media performance demonstrated that Neurospora sitophila growth was inhibited at varying rates in nitrogen supplemented media in the presence of available carbon. Notably, SEM analysis revealed Neurospora sitophila heavily colonized sawdust but not rice straw, attributed to a higher C:N ratio in sawdust.These findings suggest that lower C:N ratio negatively affects orange mold growth, highlighting nitrogen supplementation in sawdust or using rice straw as effective strategies to manage orange mold contamination in mushroom cultivation. This strategy could also be applied to other food industries where Neurospora is used.",

        "title": "Research on Government Regulation, Agricultural Socialization Service and Green Treatment Behavior of Mushroom Residue by Mushroom Farmers\u2014Based on Research Data from Gutian County, Fujian Province, China",
        "abstract": "Agricultural waste treatment in the post-production stage is a crucial component of agricultural green development. To achieve ecological revitalization, it is essential to address the pollution constraints posed by agricultural waste. This study is grounded in the survey data collected from 284 mushroom farmers in Gutian County, Fujian Province. Given that the explanatory variable pertains to the number of green treatment behavior adoptions by mushroom farmers regarding mushroom residue, which falls under the category of ordered discrete variables and exhibits an evident recurrence relationship, we opted to analyze the impacts of government regulation, agricultural socialized services, and their interaction terms on the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 mushroom residue through the Ordered Probit model. This approach enabled us to uncover how the differentiation among mushroom farmers influences their green treatment behavior. The study yielded several significant findings. Firstly, both government regulation and agricultural socialized services can effectively drive mushroom farmers to adopt green treatment behaviors for mushroom residue. Secondly, there is an interactive effect between government regulation and agricultural socialized services in relation to the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 residue, indicating a certain degree of complementarity between the two. Thirdly, the differentiation among mushroom farmers has a pronounced impact on the green treatment behavior of mushroom residue. Notably, there are distinct differences in the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers with varying education levels and planting scales. Moreover, as the education level and planting scale increase, the influence of government regulation and agricultural socialized services on the behavior of mushroom farmers tends to strengthen. Consequently, in the process of promoting the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 mushroom residue, we should maximize the utilization of the policy constraints and guiding measures of government regulation to enhance the normative role of mushroom farmers\u2019 behavior. Simultaneously, we need to fully exploit the recycling and transportation support functions of agricultural socialized services. By grasping the complementarity between government regulation and agricultural socialized services in terms of both normative behavior and solution measures, we can effectively ensure the practical feasibility of the green treatment behavior of mushroom residue.",

        "abstract": "Mushrooms are an integral part of the forest ecosystem. The forest\u2019s tree species diversity and humid environment during the monsoon period favor the ideal growth of a diverse group of mushrooms. A study was conducted in a tropical riverine forest named Sukhaura Hariyali Community Forest at Makrahar, Rupandehi, Lumbini province, to investigate the diversity of ethnomycological use of wild mushrooms. An opportunistic sampling method was used for the collection of wild mushroom samples. Thirty-three specimens of wild mushrooms were collected, and twenty-three species from sixteen genera belonging to twelve families were identified. The ethnomycological significance of collected species was also explored from the study sites. Among the surveyed species, Russula (five species) was the most widely distributed in the studied area. The ecological preference of the species revealed that a maximum of twelve species were mycorrhizal, ten species were found saprophytic, and a single species (Fomes fomentarius) was found parasitic. Ten species were found to be edible, while poisonous and inedible mushrooms comprise three and seven species respectively. Agaricus arvensis, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, and Xerocomus subtomentosus, were found to be used by locals for therapeutic purposes. The study provides the baseline data for macrofungal diversity, ecology, wild mushroom exploration, and their use.",

The analysis is embedded in onomastic and terminological research, which aimed to determine the extent of the occurrence of bionyms among the above mentioned names. The source materials were mainly academic papers on mycology, professional articles, guides and atlases of mushrooms, and Internet websites. It was found that phytonyms and anthroponyms predominate in the naming structures, while the names themselves most often function in the form of an attributive model with adjectives or adjectival participles. The exceptions here were eponyms, where the genetic model (N+NGen) predominates.",

        "abstract": "The wood processing industry is a crucial sector that utilizes forest resources to produce various value-added products. In Pontianak City, wood processing industries produce items such as door and window frames, doors, windows, and cabinets. The aim of this study is to identify clean production alternatives for the wood processing industry. The research methods include field studies and descriptive analysis of the production process and the potential waste generated. The production process in Pontianak's wood processing industry includes several stages: receiving and unloading raw materials, cutting wood to the required size, profiling products, smoothing wood surfaces, and final assembly of finished products. Each of these stages has the potential to generate waste, including unused wood scraps, wood dust, and shavings from the smoothing process. This study offers recommendations for clean technologies that can be applied to reduce this waste. These clean technologies include the production of active carbon, using wood dust waste as partition material, producing bio briquettes and wood pellets as alternative fuels, and using wood waste as a growing medium for oyster mushroom cultivation. Additionally, wood waste can be used to create creative products, such as entertainment and educational games.",

        "title": "The impact of competition for picking wild edible mushrooms and the opportunity cost for rural communities: the case of Castile and Le\u00f3n (Spain)",
        "abstract": "Picking wild edible mushrooms is a key activity both for rural as well as urban communities. Studies into the topic support the notion of the major socio-economic benefits, which increase both producer as well as consumer surplus. However, to date, no study has estimated picking harvests in the way this study does or what effects these might have on local communities with regard to other activities, both in terms of work and leisure time. This study explores both issues, taking as an indicator a variable used in conventional analysis in other sectors, yet which thus far has not been employed in wild edible mushroom picking: productivity value. The chosen study area is the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n, a Spanish region with an important and long-running mycological tradition. Using the decision-making method between individuals\u2019 leisure time and work time, the authors test the corresponding hypotheses. The results that emerge for the years analyzed (2013 and 2014) support the hypothesis of distorting/moderating effects related to the effects of picking yields on pickers\u2019 income and their impact on the individual supply for labor function of pickers.",

        "title": "Edge Computing-Based Machine Vision for Non-Invasive and Rapid Soft Sensing of Mushroom Liquid Strain Biomass",
        "abstract": "Biomass monitoring of mushroom liquid strains during the fermentation process demands real-time analysis with minimal manual intervention, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent surveillance. This study introduced a soft sensor method based on edge computing machine vision, termed Edge CV, for in situ non-invasive estimation of biomass. In our experiment, the hardware of the Edge CV system includes the Jetson Nano with 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, and a 128-core Maxwell GPU for executing intelligent machine vision tasks, along with embedded cameras for image data acquisition. Furthermore, a cascaded machine vision model was developed to enable biomass evaluation on the Edge CV system. The cascaded machine vision model mainly consists of three steps: first, the object detection task to locate the observation window, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50:95) of 82.3% with 78.7 GFLOPs; then, the segmentation task to extract liquid strain data within the observation window, yielding a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 85.9% with 110.4 GFLOPs; and finally, calculating mycelium biomass indices via the morphological image processing task. The correlation between Edge CV inference and manual measurement showed an R2 of 0.963 and an RMSE of 0.027 for normalized biomass indices, demonstrating a robust and consistent trend. Therefore, this study illustrates the practical application of edge computing-based machine vision for biomass soft sensing during the fermentation process.",
