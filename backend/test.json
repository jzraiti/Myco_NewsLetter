        "abstract": "The laccase activity changes of the Auricularia cornea var. Li strain were studied over a continuous 9-day period using different carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and lignocellulose as liquid fermentation inducers. The results showed that the addition of carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and alkaline lignin all stimulated Auricularia cornea var. Li to secrete laccase and promoted the accumulation of mycelial biomass. Both carbon and nitrogen deficiencies could stimulate Auricularia cornea var. Li to produce more laccase, but they were detrimental to the accumulation of mycelial biomass. Maltose and peptone should be prioritized as materials for cultivating high-laccase-producing Auricularia cornea var. Li strains through liquid fermentation. Lignocellulosic biomass could significantly enhance laccase activity in Auricularia cornea var. Li. During the cultivation of Auricularia cornea var. Li., wheat bran and cottonseed hulls that produced high levels of laccase should be recommended. This study partially revealed the laccase production characteristics of Auricularia cornea var. Li and identified culture substances that were beneficial for laccase secretion during different growth stages of the mushroom. The results provide a foundation for improving the yield and quality of Auricularia cornea var. Li.",

        "title": "Application of Urea Nanoparticles in Low\u2010Land Rice Fields to Boost Crop Production While Maintaining Soil Fertility and Rhizospheric Health",
        "abstract": "Nano\u2010fertilizers are becoming promising in developing novel fertilization strategies while reducing the requirements of traditional fertilizers. Nano\u2010fertilizers have high nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and are required in small doses as compared to bulk fertilizers. The use of nano fertilizers in conjunction with a reduced dose of traditional fertilizers improves nutrient availability to plants and minimizes leaching and environmental contamination. The impact of the application of such an integrated fertilization approach on the soil fertility and microbiological population also needs to be understood. The present study investigates the influence of seven field treatments, including biogenic urea nanoparticles, as a source of N nutrient developed by TERI (referred as Teri's nano urea [TNU]), with and without conventional urea in an integrated manner. These treatments include the following: (T1)\u2014100% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN), (T2)\u2014TNU alone, (T3) 100% RDN combined with TNU, (T4)\u2014TNU at 50% concentration alone, (T5)\u201475% RDN combined with TNU, (T6) 50% RDN combined with TNU, and (T7) 50% RDN alone. RDF for N, P, and K used in the experiment is 140\u00a0kg/ha of urea for nitrogen fertilizer, 60\u00a0kg/ha of phosphorus, and 70\u00a0kg/ha of potassium in accordance with the local agronomic guidelines. A variable amount of urea was applied in different treatments but the recommended dose of phosphorous and potash fertilizers was applied consistently across the treatments. In different treatments, urea nanoparticles were applied as a nitrogen source via root dipping and foliar spray. The study also incorporates the economics of using nanoparticles to supplement nitrogen in an additive manner along with non\u2010nano macronutrient sources. Further, the influence of this novel approach of fertilization was also evaluated on the native microorganism species found in the rice fields. The results for the evaluated growth parameters, yield parameters, microbial population of soil, plant uptake, and cost economics suggest that at least 25% of the conventional urea requirement can be substituted with urea nanoparticles without causing harm to the bacterial and mycological species found in the rice agricultural fields.",

        "title": "Design of Outseal PLC-Based Temperature and Humidity Regulator for Oyster Mushroom Cultivation Rooms Using Node-RED",
        "abstract": "Oyster mushroom is one type of exotic plant that has high economic value and great potential to be developed commercially. The current economic condition of mushroom cultivation is not supported by the availability of adequate investment capital and limited human resources in the oyster mushroom sector. In addition, oyster mushroom cultivation requires special skills and supporting technology. Increasingly developing technology provides more choices in technology development, especially in the field of oyster mushroom cultivation. PLC Outseal is one alternative in the development of oyster mushroom cultivation technology. PLC Outseal was chosen because it is cheap and has been proven reliable in the industrial world. Controlling room temperature 22 - 28 \u2103 and humidity 60 - 80% in oyster mushroom cultivation is very important for the success of oyster mushroom cultivation. In this study, the use of the LM35 sensor with ladder plc outseal programming has an error of 1.3% when compared to the HTC-1 digital thermometer and the humidity sensor has an error of 0.69% when compared to the SM150T. The use of RS 485 in communication up to 110 m between slaves has no obstacles and is very stable in testing between slave plc outseal. Node RED as an IoT (Internet of Things) platform is very good for monitoring the temperature and humidity of the growing media in mushroom cultivation.",

        "abstract": "Calocybe indica known as a milky white, indigenous and medicinally important edible mushroom. The cultural conditions, molecular identification, and phylogenetic relationships of selected strains of Calocybe indica were examined. The optimal temperature for mycelial development was found to be 30\u00b0C, whereas the lowest growth occurred at 15\u00b0C. The most favorable growth occurs at a pH of 5. Based on the growth characteristics of various culture media, potato dextrose agar proved to be the most advantageous, while Hennerberg and Czapek Dox media were less suitable. Molecular identification and the phylogenetic relationships of the chosen IUM strains of C. indica were examined through their ITS and RAPD analyses. The selected strains of C. indica had total sequence lengths of ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rDNA ranging from 570 to 620 bp. The sizes of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions vary among strains, with ITS2 showing greater variety than ITS1. All strains contained identical 5.8S rDNA sequences, according to sequencing analysis. Eleven out of the twenty arbitrary 10-base oligonucleotide primers utilized to amplify genomic DNA segments for the chosen C. indica strains were effective. RAPD-PCR resulted in distinct multiple products, demonstrating significant variability among the strains assessed. The quantity of amplified bands differed based on the primers utilized or the strains evaluated. The DNA polymorphisms displayed consistent traits in the replicated trials. Thus, it can be concluded that ITS sequencing and RAPD methods were effective in identifying the genetic diversity of the chosen strains of Calocybe indica.\nPlant Tissue Cult. & Biotech. 34(2): 205-216, 2024 (December)",

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is widely applied to detect different chemical compounds in organic matter and create label-free high-resolution maps on the level of separate cells. The main advantage of this technique is the possibility to study objects in vivo without special pretreatment. However, it is rarely used to determine ratios between different substances or to perform deep quantitative analysis of the obtained spectra. In our study, we derive ratiometric equations that allow estimating the mass concentrations of triacylglycerols, proteins, sugars, polysaccharides, and DNA. We show that it is possible to determine average unsaturation and chain length from the spectra of lipids and concentrations of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan from the spectra of proteins. We apply the derived equations to the Raman spectra of fungal spores of over 70 different species of macrofungi. We provide detailed characterization of lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides, which are contained in the spores. We believe that our study not only provides new fundamental knowledge in the field of mycology but also can become a basis for spectral quantification of any organic material, and our approach can be applied, for instance, to food diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The cultivation of white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) generates significant quantities of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), a byproduct traditionally treated as waste despite its nutrient- and organic-carbon-rich composition. The EU-funded project FER-PLAY identified SMS as one of the most promising circular fertilizers (i.e., those produced from waste streams, transforming them into value-added products). Within the project, a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) analysis of SMS were conducted with a cradle-to-gate-to-grave scope across three European regions, comparing it to a non-renewable mix with equivalent N, P, K, and C inputs. The LCA results reveal substantial environmental benefits of SMS over the non-renewable baseline, particularly in land use, fossil resource depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change, which together account for 98% of total impacts. Although SMS exhibits higher water consumption, it represents only 2% of total impacts. LCC highlights the critical effects of fresh mushroom substrate composition on yield, economies of scale, and revenue generation. Overall, this study highlights the significant environmental and economic potential of repurposing SMS as a soil improver, offering a compelling case for its integration into agricultural systems as part of a sustainable, circular economy.",

        "abstract": "Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is an important plantation crop in Indonesia including in Riau Province. Palm oil productivity in Riau has decreased due to several factors, one of which is disease. An important disease in\u00a0 palm oil plantations is stem base rot (BPB) caused by the fungus Ganoderma sp. This study aims to identify the causes of BPB disease of palm oil in Deli Makmur Village, Kampar Regency and Jati Baru Village, Siak Regency. This research was conducted using survey and observation methods in palm oil plantations in two villages in Kampar and Siak Districts. The identification of pathogens was carried out based on morphological characteristics by making macroscopic and microscopic observations. Initial diagnosis based on symptoms and signs palm oil plants found in Deli Makmur Village and in Jati Baru Village showed symptoms of stem base rot (BPB). The results of morphological identification show that the pathogen causing BPB disease is Ganoderma sp. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the two Ganoderma sp. fungal isolates are slightly different, where the fungal isolate from Deli Makmur Village mycelium grows sideways, has a smooth and very thick texture, there are concentric rings, crystals and cuticular cells. While the mushroom isolate from Jati Baru Village mycelium grows sideways, has a fine texture, is quite thick, and there are no ring-shaped concentric, crystals and cuticular cells.",

        "abstract": "\u00a0\nAmong the cultivated mushrooms, Pleurotus spp. occupies an important place and is being produced on a large scale, globally. In terms of mushroom output, India is still increasing at a very moderate rate of 4.3 per cent. One of the major reasons responsible for such slow growth rate is the dipteran fly, Bradysia tritici (Coquillett). In this light, present study was conducted to check the susceptibility level of different Pleurotus spp. against B. tritici and the effect of organic products viz., Cow urine, Panchgavya, Jeevamrit and Dashgavya for the management of this pest. Among the four Pleurotus species screened against B. tritici, all were found to be vulnerable; P. cornucopiae being the most susceptible followed by P. florida, P. ostreatus and P. sajor caju. Out of the organic products, dashgavya at 10 per cent was the only suitable product which not only reduced the insect population but also improved the mushroom yields. Therefore, keeping in view the environment safety and crop yield, preventive spray of dashgavya can be given to manage this pest. Additionally, as a part of integrated pest management, these low-cost organic solutions can be tested in turn benefiting the mushroom industry.\u00a0",

        "title": "The Potential of Sitka Spruce Bark as an Alternative to Peat Casing for Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) Production",
        "abstract": "White button mushrooms are an important crop globally, and due to the role of peat in current cultivation practices, the industry is under increasing pressure to find suitable alternatives. Peat functions as \u201ccasing\u201d, a surface layer that, amongst other functions, provides available water to the fungal mycelium and is considered essential for mushroom growth. This research aimed to determine the potential of bark as an alternative casing material and its suitability for commercial mushroom production. Two experiments were conducted, comparing two types of commercially available peat casing with bark-based casings. The bark casing in Experiment A was found to be statistically similar to the peat casing in terms of yield and quality. The two bark casings in Experiment B failed to produce a 1st flush of mushrooms, and total yields were significantly lower compared to the peat casings, highlighting the fact that the consistency of the bark material across both experiments was variable. There were several issues associated with the bark casing, which included water stress and cropping delays, all of which would be unacceptable from a commercial perspective. Further research is required to refine bark-based casing, focusing on a better consistency of the bark feedstock and reduction of contamination risk. This work contributes to ongoing research and development to address the dependency of mushroom production on peat.",

        "title": "Pleurotus spp: A cosmopolitan fungi of biotechnological importance",
        "abstract": "The genus Pleurotus presents a multivariate species diversity due to its ability to grow in different substrates and environments. Whether wild or cultivated, they are edible mushrooms, as they present a high nutritional value and are medicinal due to their bioactive compounds with positive health effects. The aim of this review is to highlight the importance of the genus Pleurotus, since it is a cosmopolitan mushroom, and its properties can be used in different industrial applications and be a functional alternative for our future. Due to their saprophytic nature, they produce enzymes that act on the substrate in which they grow, degrading lignocellulosic material such as wood, forest and agricultural residues, hardwoods, wood by-products, cereal straw, bagasse, etc., and thanks to this degradative capacity, their enzymes are used in a wide range of biotechnological and environmental applications. In order to increase their production and consumption not only for their nutritional qualities, but also for their nutraceutical and biotechnological qualities, ease of cultivation, low investment cost, etc., new ways are being sought to increase their performance in cultivation. Recently, research has expanded the search for alternative uses of the Pleurotus genus, which has led to an increase in its cultivation, as well as its application in different fields of biotechnology. The cultivation of Pleurotus mushrooms represents an opportunity to generate a sustainable process and incorporate the process into a circular economy, generating environmental, social and economic benefits. The use of agro-industrial substrates and the subsequent reuse of the spent substrate as compost or organic fertilizer reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and minimizes methane production. This allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly production model. Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies for the promotion, marketing and sustainable production of products derived from these fungi.",

        "abstract": "Single-spore isolation is a fundamental technique for exploring genetic diversity in fungi, particularly in heterothallic species like Pleurotus ostreatus. This study outlines a method for isolating single spores from fruiting bodies, aimed at facilitating genetic improvement of mushrooms. The approach is especially suitable for the laboratories of mushrooms which are not necessarily well-funded, requiring only basic laboratory equipment. It is simple, resistant to contamination, and highly efficient. Under sterile conditions, spores were collected from mature mushroom fruiting bodies using a sterilized cotton swab and subjected to serial dilutions in distilled water. Each dilution was plated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and then incubated, producing a consistent source of genetically uniform mycelium for further study. Further, microscopic examinations revealed the presence of clamp connections, specialized structures that ensure genetic stability and facilitate cell division during hyphal growth. This method is broadly applicable, though fungi that do not germinate on artificial media may require an alternative approach.\nRes. Agric. Livest. Fish. Vol. 11, No. 3, December 2024: 383-388",

        "title": "Annotated Checklist of Poroid Hymenochaetoid Fungi in Central Asia: Taxonomic Diversity, Ecological Roles, and Potential Distribution Patterns",
        "abstract": "Central Asia, located at the heart of Eurasia, is renowned for its varied climate and vertical vegetative distribution, which support diverse biomes and position it as a global biodiversity hotspot. Despite this ecological richness, Central Asia\u2019s fungal diversity, particularly wood-inhabiting macrofungi, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the diversity, ecological roles, and potential distribution of poroid Hymenochaetoid fungi in the region. By conducting field surveys, collecting basidiomes, and reviewing the literature and herbarium records from five Central Asian countries, we compiled a comprehensive checklist of these fungi. In total, 43 Hymenochaetoid species belonging to 18 genera were identified, with Inonotus, Phellinus, and Phylloporia being the most species-rich. Notably, Inonotus hispidus and Phellinus igniarius were found to be the most widespread species. These macrofungi play essential ecological roles as saprotrophs and pathogens of various identified host plant families, aiding in lignin degradation and exhibiting diverse enzymatic activities. For the first time, we modelled the potential distribution patterns of Hymenochaetoid fungi in Central Asia, revealing that their distribution is strongly influenced by host plant availability and temperature-related factors. The three most critical variables were host plant density, annual temperature range (Bio7), and mean temperature of the warmest quarter (Bio10). The distribution of suitable habitats is uneven, with highly suitable areas (4.52%) concentrated in the mountainous border regions between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. These results underscore the significance of specific environmental conditions for the growth and survival of Hymenochaetoid fungi in this region. Our findings highlight the urgent need for continued mycological and host plant research and expanded conservation initiatives to document and preserve macrofungal and botanical biodiversity in this under-explored area. In light of climate change, the collected mycological and botanical data provide a valuable reference for promoting forest health management globally.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the effects of germination substrates incorporating spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and locally sourced organic materials on the growth and vigor of cocoa seedlings. Seven treatments were evaluated using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD), comprising combinations of coconut coir, rice husk, sugarcane bagasse, and biochar.\u00a0Key findings reveal that treatments combining SMS, sugarcane bagasse, and either coconut coir or biochar (T6 and T7) achieved significantly higher survival rates and Dickson Quality Index (DQI) scores compared to conventional soil (T1). These treatments provided favorable chemical properties, including optimal pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrient content (N, P, K), which are critical for cocoa seedling development. The results suggest that using SMS with agricultural waste as an alternative germination medium can reduce cultivation costs, enhance seedling growth, and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices by repurposing organic waste. This approach not only offers cost-effective benefits for farmers but also mitigates environmental impacts associated with waste disposal.",

        "title": "Mycoremediation of Louisiana sweet crude oil with Pleurotus ostreatus and nutrient amendments",
        "abstract": "\n Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are known to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in petroleum crude oil, making them candidates for oil spill remediation studies. This work aimed to assess P. ostreatus for its hydrocarbon degradation potential in estuarine conditions. In vitro experiments evaluated nutrient amendments based on P. ostreatus carbon: nitrogen: phosphorous (C: N: P) ratios to optimize mycelium growth, increase degradation efficiencies, and reduce potential nutrient run-off in broader applications. Image analysis was used to track mycelium growth response to various salinities, nutrient amendments, and oil types. Subsequent evaluation of alterations within the saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) fractions constituting Louisiana Sweet Crude (LSC) were conducted via SARA analysis. Results indicate that P. ostreatus mycelium tolerates estuarine salinities, with maximum growth between 5-15 \u2030. Relative to 0 \u2030, growth was reduced at salinities >25 \u2030, but positive growth was still observed. Nutrient amendments significantly increased growth over seven days relative to untreated samples (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The combination of ammonium chloride and potassium phosphate yielded optimal mycelium growth after 7\u2009days. Mycelium and nutrients significantly altered saturate (p\u2009=\u20090.0015) and asphaltene (p\u2009=\u20090.0124) fractions in LSC. This study suggests that mycelium growth is viable under estuarine salinities and can be enhanced with nutrient amendments. Introducing nutrient factors was shown to influence oil degradation. Results also indicate that mycelium can reduce recalcitrant oil fractions. Thus, this study highlights the adaptability of P. ostreatus to estuarine conditions and its response to nutrient amendments, all while offering a promising approach to crude oil bioremediation.",

        "title": "137Cs accumulation by woody plants and edible mushrooms at the \u00abTaiga\u00bb peaceful nuclear explosions site",
        "abstract": "In 1971 in the Perm region (the Russian Federation), three thermonuclear charges of the \u201cTaiga\u201d series were simultaneously detonated in order to test nuclear explosive technologies for creation of the Pechora-Kama canal. As a result of the underground explosions, long-lived technogenic radionuclides were released onto the surface of the earth along with soil and rock. Over time, a new forest ecosystem formed on the mound of the radioactively contaminated ground. The purpose of this study was to assess the 137Cs accumulation by woody plants and edible mushrooms at the \u201cTaiga\u201d underground nuclear explosions site at a remote stage (38 years) after radioactive contamination of the environment. Content of 137Cs was determined in organs of birch (Betula pubescens), spruce (Picea abies), aspen (Populus tremula), and pine (Pinus sylvestris), as well as in the fruiting bodies of mushrooms of the species Boletus edulis, Leccinum aurantiacum, Russula, and Suillus luteus. The activities of 137Cs in the samples were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry using a HPGe detector. The values of 137Cs activity concentration (on a dry weight basis) in the samples of wood, leaves/needles (1st year), and mushrooms were in the ranges of 0.5\u20136.8 Bq/kg, 54\u2013112 Bq/kg, and 212-3260 Bq/kg, respectively. Aggregated transfer coefficients (kg/m2) for the radionuclide in the biota species were calculated using these results and previously reported data on the density of soil contamination by 137Cs at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site. It has been found that the transfer coefficients of 137Cs from soil to biota for all studied species at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site are abnormally low compared to those obtained by many authors for other places of radioactive contamination, in particular for the areas contaminated by 137Cs as a result of the Chernobyl accident. Possible reasons for the low accumulation of 137Cs in the biota at the \u201cTaiga\u201d site are discussed.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n \nIn today\u2019s world, environmental sustainability and resource conservation have become major concerns globally. In general, logistics, and more specifically, transportation time, play a crucial role in decision-making aimed at reducing spoilage and related expenses. This study investigates how variations in transportation time impact inventory management costs in food waste recycling across three sectors: composting, mushroom cultivation, and insect farming. A synthetic dataset was created, simulating realistic scenarios in food waste management, including variables such as transportation time, type of waste, energy usage, seasonal variations, and inventory management costs. Computational models and statistical analyses, including moderation and mediation analyses, were conducted using R programming language to evaluate three hypotheses. The results indicate a marginal moderating impact of waste type, where perishable waste marginally increased the cost impact of transportation time without reaching conventional significance. Energy usage mediated the relationship, where increased transportation time correlated with increased energy use and costs. Seasonal variations moderated the relationship, especially in winter and summer, indicating enhanced sensitivity to transport time. \n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n",

The consistent illumination in the dataset enhances the robustness and practical usability of the assessed models. Using a weighted scoring system that incorporates precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and average precision (AP), ResNet-50 achieved the highest overall score of 99.70%, demonstrating outstanding performance across all disease categories. DenseNet-201 and DarkNet-53 followed closely, confirming their reliability in classification tasks with high recall and precision values. Confusion matrices and ROC curves further validated the classification capabilities of the models.

        "title": "Tetracycline Degradation by Persulfate Assisted by Fe and N Co-Doped Biochar Derived from Spent Mushroom Substrate for Sustainability: Effect of Pyrolysis Temperature",
        "abstract": "Mushroom production is increasing rapidly worldwide, raising public concern about the contamination effects of spent mushroom substrates (SMS). Preparation of Fe\u2013N-doped biochar (Fe-N-BC) from SMS as a raw material for catalytic degradation of antibiotics in water may be an effective and sustainable solid waste treatment. However, there is limited information available. This study investigated the effect and potential mechanism of SMS-based Fe-N-BC prepared at 300, 600, and 900 \u00b0C to catalyze persulfate (PS) for tetracycline (TC) removal. The results indicated that the catalytic performance of Fe-N-BC was significantly enhanced with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Notably, Fe-N-BC prepared at 900 \u00b0C exhibited high TC removal efficiency, with 95% TC removal at 120 min. This might be closely related to the fact that the Fe-N-BC prepared at high temperatures had more Fe oxides and active sites. Adsorption and radical and non-radical pathways were the main mechanisms for TC removal by Fe-N-BC/PS systems, especially the contribution of SO4\u00b7\u2212. By identifying the degradation products, three possible pathways of TC degradation were proposed, and the toxicity of the degradation intermediates was evaluated. The results of the reusability analysis indicated that the Fe-N-BC prepared at 900 \u00b0C had good potential for practical application, and the TC removal rate still reached 76%, even after five cycles. These findings provide valuable reference information for solid waste resources\u2019 sustainable utilization and the remediation of antibiotic-contaminated water.",

        "abstract": "Mold contamination, particularly from green and orange molds, poses a serious threat during the growing stage in mushroom cultivation, exacerbated throughout the hot and humid summer months. Despite extensive studies on green mold, orange mold remains underexplored. Consequently, this study comprehensively investigated orange mold contamination, focusing on identifying the causal agent, assessing its pathogenicity, and exploring potential countermeasures.Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing was used to confirm the causative entity, while the dual confrontation plate method was employed to assess pathogenicity. Furthermore, control strategies, including plant extract, in vitro media performance, and substrate characteristics, were explored. For estimated substrate qualities, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, along with analysis of physicochemical properties including the C:N ratio, carbon, protein, and mineral content were assessed.The result confirmed Neurospora sitophila as the causal entity. The pathogenicity assessments indicated that this mold impedes the colonization of mushroom mycelium by competing for nutrients and space. The in-vitro studies of media performance demonstrated that Neurospora sitophila growth was inhibited at varying rates in nitrogen supplemented media in the presence of available carbon. Notably, SEM analysis revealed Neurospora sitophila heavily colonized sawdust but not rice straw, attributed to a higher C:N ratio in sawdust.These findings suggest that lower C:N ratio negatively affects orange mold growth, highlighting nitrogen supplementation in sawdust or using rice straw as effective strategies to manage orange mold contamination in mushroom cultivation. This strategy could also be applied to other food industries where Neurospora is used.",

        "title": "Research on Government Regulation, Agricultural Socialization Service and Green Treatment Behavior of Mushroom Residue by Mushroom Farmers\u2014Based on Research Data from Gutian County, Fujian Province, China",
        "abstract": "Agricultural waste treatment in the post-production stage is a crucial component of agricultural green development. To achieve ecological revitalization, it is essential to address the pollution constraints posed by agricultural waste. This study is grounded in the survey data collected from 284 mushroom farmers in Gutian County, Fujian Province. Given that the explanatory variable pertains to the number of green treatment behavior adoptions by mushroom farmers regarding mushroom residue, which falls under the category of ordered discrete variables and exhibits an evident recurrence relationship, we opted to analyze the impacts of government regulation, agricultural socialized services, and their interaction terms on the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 mushroom residue through the Ordered Probit model. This approach enabled us to uncover how the differentiation among mushroom farmers influences their green treatment behavior. The study yielded several significant findings. Firstly, both government regulation and agricultural socialized services can effectively drive mushroom farmers to adopt green treatment behaviors for mushroom residue. Secondly, there is an interactive effect between government regulation and agricultural socialized services in relation to the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 residue, indicating a certain degree of complementarity between the two. Thirdly, the differentiation among mushroom farmers has a pronounced impact on the green treatment behavior of mushroom residue. Notably, there are distinct differences in the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers with varying education levels and planting scales. Moreover, as the education level and planting scale increase, the influence of government regulation and agricultural socialized services on the behavior of mushroom farmers tends to strengthen. Consequently, in the process of promoting the green treatment behavior of mushroom farmers\u2019 mushroom residue, we should maximize the utilization of the policy constraints and guiding measures of government regulation to enhance the normative role of mushroom farmers\u2019 behavior. Simultaneously, we need to fully exploit the recycling and transportation support functions of agricultural socialized services. By grasping the complementarity between government regulation and agricultural socialized services in terms of both normative behavior and solution measures, we can effectively ensure the practical feasibility of the green treatment behavior of mushroom residue.",

        "title": "In Vivo Effectiveness of Pleurotus ostreatus in Degradation of Toxic Metabolites of Filamentous Fungi Such as Aflatoxin B1 and Zearalenone",
        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Mycotoxins, secondary metabolites synthesized by filamentous fungi, have been classified as dangerous substances and proven to be carcinogenic, as well as to have genotoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic properties. Despite numerous trials to develop an effective and safe-for-human-health method of detoxification, there is still a high risk associated with the occurrence of these toxins in food and feed. Biological methods of food preservation are an alternative option to conventional chemical and physical methods, characterized by their less negative impact on human health as well as their high efficiency against filamentous fungi and other foodborne pathogens. Mycoremediation is a new biotechnique based on the capability of fungi to detoxify matrices from various pullulans. Ligninolytic enzymes produced by white rot fungi (WRF) characterize a high efficiency in the degradation of various mycotoxins. Methods: In our study, Pleurotus\u00a0ostreatus, as a representative of WRF, was cultivated on a medium contaminated by AFB1 and ZEN (mushroom substrate and maize) in a few variants of concentration. After the cultivation, medium and fruiting bodies were collected and analyzed with the usage of HPLC and LC/MS methods. Results: The reduction oscillated between 53 and 87% (AFB1) and 73 and 97% (ZEN) depending on the initial concentration of toxins in the medium. Grown fruiting bodies contained insignificant amounts of both toxins. Conclusions: These findings confirm the potential of P.\u00a0ostreatus as an effective biological agent for reducing mycotoxins in contaminated medium, highlighting its applicability in developing sustainable and safe methods for detoxification.",

        "abstract": "The diversity and resource potential of macroscopic fungi in tropical regions remain understudied. Vietnam, being in a biodiversity hotspot, has a large number of new fungal species that are of interest for biotechnology and medicine. The presence of a large number of protected areas in Vietnam creates favorable opportunities for the study and ex situ conservation of tropical biodiversity. From 2012 to 2023, 785 strains of macrofungi from National Parks of Vietnam were preserved in the LE-BIN collection, 327 of which were barcoded with the sequences deposited in the NCBI GenBank. A taxonomic analysis demonstrated that many of the preserved isolates are potentially new or poorly studied species, representing a useful resource for taxonomical studies and a search for new medicinal mushrooms. More than 180 strains were studied for the first time for growth rate and enzymatic activities. Of these, 53 strains showed high growth rate, 43\u2014high cellulolytic activity, 73\u2014high oxidative enzymes activity, and 27 showed high proteolytic activity, making them promising candidates for biotechnological and medical applications and opening new opportunities for sustainable biomass management, discovery of new enzymes and bioactive substances, development of new drugs and efficient plant waste treatment technologies. The results confirm the importance of the ex situ conservation of fungal diversity in tropical regions as a valuable source for scientific and commercial applications and suggest certain new active strains for biotechnological study.",

        "abstract": "Biomass monitoring of mushroom liquid strains during the fermentation process demands real-time analysis with minimal manual intervention, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent surveillance. This study introduced a soft sensor method based on edge computing machine vision, termed Edge CV, for in situ non-invasive estimation of biomass. In our experiment, the hardware of the Edge CV system includes the Jetson Nano with 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, and a 128-core Maxwell GPU for executing intelligent machine vision tasks, along with embedded cameras for image data acquisition. Furthermore, a cascaded machine vision model was developed to enable biomass evaluation on the Edge CV system. The cascaded machine vision model mainly consists of three steps: first, the object detection task to locate the observation window, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50:95) of 82.3% with 78.7 GFLOPs; then, the segmentation task to extract liquid strain data within the observation window, yielding a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 85.9% with 110.4 GFLOPs; and finally, calculating mycelium biomass indices via the morphological image processing task. The correlation between Edge CV inference and manual measurement showed an R2 of 0.963 and an RMSE of 0.027 for normalized biomass indices, demonstrating a robust and consistent trend. Therefore, this study illustrates the practical application of edge computing-based machine vision for biomass soft sensing during the fermentation process.",

Drawing on theories of sociomateriality and material agency, and utilising multispecies microethnography, the paper attends to the specificities of making, makers, materials and artefacts in biomaking. It explores a case of a Finnish upper secondary school workshop implemented as part of the school's art curriculum within a larger educational development initiative. In the workshop, makers engaged with webcap mushrooms to extract, use and experiment with their pigments. The analysis builds on constructed operational sequences of the workshop activities, and a scrutiny of their interconnections, stages and participants. The paper shows how making, emergent artefacts and interplays of makers\u2019 intentions and materialities can instate moments of relationality and learning, and thus build makers\u2019 material awareness of the more\u2010than\u2010human organisms around them. The study proposes making with the biological as an attunement to our enmeshment with the environment.",
